My stay at the Hotel Allegro Chicago was an amazing experience ! The staff were helpful and considerate , always there to tend to my needs . My suite was extremely clean , and had all the amenities that I could ask for . I almost did n't want to leave my room , because it was so nice . But in the end I did , because the hotel is situated in such a great area , that I had to go out and see some of the sites . This hotel has wonderful rooms and service , and is in a really great area . I suggest that everyone come here if they are staying in Chicago .

The Affinia Chicago is a wonderful place to stay , my husband and I stayed there for a week to visit some family and had an amazing time . The rooms were very well organized and comfortable , the staff there are very friendly , and the food there is more then amazing . we are defiantly going back next year .

I was recently a guest at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers and was immensely dissatisfied . I arrived to find that they had `` lost '' my reservation . They told me they were booked solid even though I had produced my copy of the reservation confirmation . After nearly an hour of arguing with the front desk clerk she finally asked for the hotel manager to step in . He was almost helpful . He searched the database and found that there was a `` cancellation '' ; however , it was not for the type of room I had reserved . I had asked for a suite as I was going to be staying in the hotel for several days . I was given a box with a bed in it . They made no apologies for losing my reservation and offered no alternate compensation . Unfortunately , I was in town for a conference and everyone in the area was completely booked . I had no choice but to accept what they had offered . I begrudgingly accepted this with the intention of contacting the corporate office and posting my review here . Do not stay in this hotel they will NOT help you with anything , even if it was their error .

Grant it , this hotel seems very nice , but I was not at all pleased with my stay here . The customer service was horrible . I had to request more towels and washcloths several times before receiving them and my linen had not been replaced either . For as much as I paid to stay here , you 'd think the least you 'd get is an iron . Not ! I had to request an iron , too ! In addition to all of the failed amenities , I was mistakenly charged twice for my stay and was n't reimbursed until an entire week later . The next time I choose to visit Chicago , Swissotel will be the last place I think to stay .

The Hotel Monaco claims to be a `` boutique Chicago luxury hotel , '' but it certainly was neither luxurious nor stylish . The pictures posted on the website imply that the guest is going to stay in a room with an amazing view , but that was certainly not the case for this customer ! The decor , which might be `` cutesy '' or `` charming '' to some was actually quite tacky and outdated . The bathrooms had a musty smell and did not meet the cleanliness standards of a hotel claiming to be `` one of the top 40 hotels U.S. '' Do n't be fooled by a snappy website with some selective photos -- this hotel does not live up to its billing . You will be disappointed , as was I , if you expect anything more than a run-of-the-mill experience at a merely average hotel .

I just got back from the Monaco in Chicago ! I was very pleasantly surprised , as my husband booked this trip as a last minute getaway , and he usually picks bad places-haha . Anyway , the moment we got there the doormen greeted us warmly and helped get our luggage situatated . It was busy and the line was a little long , but it moved quickly . The lady at the front desk gave us a high floor when we requested one which was very good , especially since it seemed to be near full . The room was clean and spacious ( especially considering it 's a city hotel ) . We made a lot of use of the concierge , since again , it was so last minute we did n't really make any plans . He gave us some tips and also gave us a few places we should go for Chicago pizza yummy ! It was also great being near the theater district , and basically in the thick of everything so we saved on cab fare . I thought the coolest thing was they brought you a goldfish in a bowl for your room ! very trendy . My husband is not as easily impressed , but he was really excited about the free wine hour and the free drinks in the afternoon . Overall , really nice stay in a four star , or probably four and half star hotel !

When we stayed at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel in Chicago , we had one of the worst visits i have ever experienced . Our room was not ready right away so we had to wait about an hour in the lobby . And finally when we made it to our room we found a moldy shower and a dirty floor . The room service took about an hours and a half to come to the room and she we went to the pool that day , it was so crowded there was no room to sit on the side . Our experience was definitely not a pleasant one . To make matters even worse , we were billed twice for our room which my husband luckily caught before we left . I am never coming back to Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel .

For a hotel that touts its luxury location in Chicago the Talbot is very poor ( think Motel 6 at a Hilton price ) . Carpet is threadbare and the walls are paper thin . They are so worried about the mini-bar they constantly do these random room checks , so privacy and sleeping in are unheard of . For the prices they charge ( $ 350.average price for two people ) . It seems like the money spent on remodeling the exquisite lobby , which was happening while I stayed , could have been better spent on better insulation and more up-to-date furnishings for the guest rooms . But I guess the Talbot is more concerned with first impressions than they are returning guests , which I wo n't be .

I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency in downtown Chicago . My stay here was wonderful thanks to such a friendly staff . I needed to do some research for work and the free Wi-Fi made this very easy . The bed was so nice and soft ! Even the pillows were fluffy . I was able to put my valuables in the in-room safe . The local restaurants were amazing . I will recommend this to my friends and I am staying here again in the future .

My boyfriend and I wanted to spend a four-day weekend in downtown Chicago and do all the touristy things ; shop the Magnificient Mile , see Shedd aquarium , go to the museum of Science and Industry . Homewood Suites was conveniently located near all of these things . It was a luxurious treat of a weekend ! We even swam in their rooftop indoor pool . It was also nice to have the amenities of a suite , so we could prepare our own meals some days . The staff was friendly and courteous ( they even gave me an extra pillow on request ! ) and we would definitely stay there again .

I would like to add a comment , maybe this will help others when choosing for a wedding destination . My daughter was married in May of 2010 and we decided to have the special event at the Sofitel Water Tower ; we were amazed . She always wanted a ballroom type of wedding , and Sofitel made this happen for her . They took care of all the invitations , cake decor , and so much more . The special day for my daughter was worth everything . If you are going to be in the Chicago area , check them out ; you will not regret it !

If you are ever going to visit Chicago and need a place to stay I recommend this hotel . This hotel made my stay in Chicago one that I will always remember . The rooms were very big and luxurious , everybody was friendly and showed a fabulous display of customer service . The room service always got there when they said it would and it was nice because it was 24 hours so I could get anything whenever I wanted . The price of this hotel for my stay was unbeatable especially because I got great service and I saved a lot compared to the rates of other hotels in the area and their two restaurants were exquisite . If you are ever going to be in the Chicago area and need a hotel to stay in I recommend this hotel !

The Conrad Chicago hotel had some of the worst service I have ever dealt with . I got the Executive Room with a king size bed . When I got in , the sheets were stained with some type of chocolate or mud . I called down to front desk and it took them an hour to come up and change them for me . They have a pillow menu which I tried to select from but they were out of over half of them . The Ipod dock was not working either . Also , the room service servers were very short with me and delivered my food luke warm . This hotel is the worst in Chicago and I would never recommend going there !

Beautiful hotel in chicago . I visited this hotel on my honeymoon with my wife . They are pet friendly and even provide in room spa services . I would recommend hotel monaco if you are looking to stay in a luxury hotel in chicago .
1
I stayed at the monaco for the Labor day weekend when I visited my family in Chicago . It is one of the nicest hotels i have stayed at in my life . clean , comfortable and pretty . The rooms were clean and the staff is very caring . I needed some more glasses as my family was sharing drink . The front desk had them sent up in less than 10 minutes . I will recommend Monaco to anyone who will be staying in the Chicago area .

The name `` Hard Rock '' might trigger images of hip rockers but you will be sorely disappointed by staying here . The website alludes to musicians and parties but if you 're looking to hob nob with the rich and famous the Hard Rock falls short . The hotel puts on a kitchy show by the decorations in the lobby and around the property but there is nothing exciting about this . The service is mediocre and the rooms are n't clean . I stayed at this hotel last year for a long weekend in Chicago and was very much looking forward to some fun , exciting romance . I should have picked somewhere else . Save your money .

When my boyfriend and I checked into our room at the Omni Chicago , we were irritated to see that the bed looked rumpled , as if kids had been jumping on it . That was just the first of our `` issues '' . The glasses in the bathroom had lipstick smears on them , and I saw a ( dead-thank goodness ! ) roach behind the toilet . We were given the hotel night stay by a friend , so we decided to just deal with it . We ordered some munchies from the kitchen , and the chips were stale , and the dip smelled sour . After coming back from the convenience store with beer and some fresh munchies , we were able to enjoy our stay -- but I would not recommend this place to anyone !

A friend and I stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago for a weekend while visiting a mutual friend of ours for her Birthday . The hotel at first glance was very nice and charming . But , We quickly found out that was not the case . Our room reeked of smoke when we first stepped in . The bathroom was filthy , it looked as though it had not been cleaned in weeks ! ! There was mold around the toilet and a film over the mirror . There were also very large stains all over the carpet through the room . We immediately called the front desk to tell about our smelly , unkempt room . The women at the front desk was rude and assured us that what we were smelling `` was not smoke '' because that is not permitted in the hotel . We were also told that room was cleaned that day . After several minutes of arguing with her and a manager , we were moved to a another room which took 2 hours because there were no other clean rooms available at that time . WE had to sit in the lobby with our baggage until one was made available for us . The food we ordered from the restaurant was horrible and WAY over priced . Our waiter was rude and only stopped by our table twice the whole time we were there . All the staff at this hotel seemed unhappy and barley even acknowledged any of the guests . I will never stay here again and I would never recommend this hotel to any one .

Me and my wife stayed at the Omni hotel in Chicago for a customer training at a nearby hospital . We ended up only staying for 2 nights and the service was awful here . At first once coming into the room , there was a mildewy smell in the air , which we were fortunate enough to bring a potpourri spray with us just incase . The continental breakfast each morning was terrible as well . The eggs were runny and the coffee was not hot at all . To make matters even worse , the room service attendant did not get to our rooms until the middle of the afternoon , when my wife was back from exploring the city . This was simply unacceptable by any standard .

My husband and I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park . What I expected to be a very pleasant experience , turned out to be a stressful visit . We specifically reserved a non-smoking king room and paid the price for that reservation . Upon arrival , the hotel did not have any non-smoking rooms available and the representative at the check in desk was not helpful . As we had no other options , we accepted a smoking room with two queen beds . I can live with the bed situation but I truly feel that having to accept a room infused with cigarette smoke is completely wrong ! There was n't an area in the room where I did not feel nauseous from the stale smell and I can not help but think that this smell followed me around all day after check out . To add insult to injury , the hotel staff was not sympathetic to our situation -- something I think they should be specifically trained to do -- and did not offer any compensation , partial refund or related `` perk '' to make up for our great inconvenience . Two staff members actually acted as if I was the inconvenience in asking them if there was anything they could do ! Although we paid for the breakfast package , we were eager to leave immediately in the morning and dined elsewhere at our additional expense . Pardon the pun , but we just could not sit there and dine in the morning with such a bad taste in our mouth from the hotel 's lack of customer service ! I am hoping the corporate office responds to our complaints but , thus far , we have received no satisfaction . Needless to say , we will not be visiting this property again ! In fact , we are no longer going to patronize this brand of hotels .

I recently stayed at the Homewood Suites by Hilton Chicago Downtown , and found it lacking in the quality of their service . The rooms are nice and well furnished , but the service lacks in some areas . Some of the complimentary services include fast-speed wireless internet access , cardio-fitness and indoor pool , grocery shopping service and coffee , tea , hot chocolate or cider all day long in the lobby 's 24 hour convenience shop . However the wireless internet was spotty at best with really slow speed at times , the indoor pool was far to cold in my opinion and the cardio equipment was left uncleaned . The grocery shopping service was alright , although a bit on the slow side and then finally the coffee and hot chocolate in the 24 hour convenience shop were both cold and overall of poor quality . Rating this Hotel on a scale of 1 to 5 , I would give it a 3 at best .
1
I was unimpressed by the quality of this hotel . The overall look of the place was marred by what felt like poor maintenance . Given that this is supposed to be a luxury hotel and charges rates at that level , this was most disappointing . Nor was I impressed with the snooty attitude taken by the hotel staff .

I 've stayed at several different hotels in Chicago but The James is the best . Everything I need is in walking distance and I find it very convenient to stay there . The staff at the concierge desk is so polite and offers assistance willingly . The room has always been very clean . The bed linens are better that the nice sheets I have on my own bed . Thankfully I do n't have to search around for somewhere to stay when I travel there as I 've found my favorite .

It was my first time to visit Chicago and I would say , i 'd definitely go back , not just because of the Air and Water Show that we really enjoyed , but most importantly , because of the hotel that we stayed in . The Millennium Knickerbocker is not just accommodating to their human guests , but with pets too . At first I was reluctant that they will give us accommodations because of my pet dog , but I was surprised it turned out the other way . I 've experienced being denied reservations because of my dog and that 's really frustrating , it 's just nice that there still are other hotels that are pet friendly . I would definitely recommend this hotel to my friends if they plan to visit Chicago .

I recently stayed in the Talbott Hotel in Chicago with my family of three . I absolutely loved it and will definitely return ! The customer service of the staff at the front desk was fantastic . They were very helpful in helping us decide on what activities to do and what restaurants to visit during our stay . For the nights we did n't want to go out , we had room service . The food from the Hotel restaurant was so delicious and the service was very quick . I also loved their commitment to the environment . It is clear to me why they have won so many awards . Thank you Talbott for a wonderful stay !

My stay at the Hyatt Regency was an experience that I 'll never ever forget - not in a good way . Check-in was actually pretty easy and the clerk was pleasant . I went up to my room and looked around , all seemed ok at first . I was bushed so I flopped on the bed ... ohhhhh noooooo ! The bed was as hard as a military bunk from my Army days . But I was so tired that I just passed out . Of course I woke up with a back ache ... great . I figured a hot soak in the tub would help my back so I plugged the tub , turned the hot water on full force , and poured in some shower gel . I put my foot in expecting some real heat - the water was barely lukewarm . I called the front desk but they were no help , the clerk just apologized . Frustrated at this point , I turned on the tv and switched on the air . I put my hand over the vent to see how cold the air was and I saw something slimy inside of the vent . It looked like a wet gray chunk of goop or something . I could n't take anymore of this . I went down to the front desk and complained to the clerk . It seemed as though the guy was on something - he kept smiling as he apologized , no empathy as if he 's used to hearing about the goop in the ac . He offered me a free night but there is no way that I 'd stay at this place again - ever .

Hard Rock Hotel is a must to visit . No matter what city your in Hard Rock Hotel is the place to stay . Filled with fun and unique traits to the rooms and dining . This Hotel is the place to be . Great views in every location , especially Chicago . The service is incredible along with the food and decor . The Hotel staff will help you feel right at home , no BETTER than home : )
1
This hotel is located right in the hustle and bustle of the city of Chicago . It is ideal for the corporate executive . Not only in terms of location but the hotel offers a spectacular view of the ocean . The dining room is spacious and makes eating at this hotel a really pleasant experience . While dining the guest experiences a nice ambiance as they overlook the city , which is picturesque especially at night , when the city lights come on . The rooms are nice and spacious and allows the guest to get all their work done with a desk area . I would strongly recommend this hotel for the corporate executive !

WARNING ! My stay at the Talbott Hotel will go down in history as one of my worst experiences staying in hotels . I was excited for a weekend getaway with a few friends . After receiving a few positive recommendations and looking at their website we decided to stay at the Talbott . They were promoting up to $ 30 breakfast credit per day . And breakfast is my favorite meal so this was already looking like a great time . Upon our arrival we were greeted by an employee ( which we would n't have known had he not told us ) that was not only rude but made sexual advances at one of the ladies on our group . Once we talked with a manager about the incident outside he assured us that he would take care of the issue and even upgraded us to King suites instead of the double size rooms we originally reserved . If someone had blindfolded me and took me into one of these rooms I would have sworn we were at Motel 6 , not a luxury hotel in Chicago . The linens were stained , room smelled of smoke and had another odor that was similar to old cat pee . I was truly disgusted . After a night out on the town we came back to our disgusting rooms to get some sleep . The next morning I was excited for our breakfast that was highly recommended by the hotel and other guests . I have to say it was one of the worst breakfasts I have ever eaten . The toast was stale , eggs were made from powder instead of real eggs , and the juice they served was sour . I would never recommend this as a place to stay . I would suggest the Red Roof Inn over this place anytime .

I visited the Hotel Allegro Chicago while I was on vacation with my daughter . I booked the room and was very excited because the website alludes to a very lavish interior with amenities far superior to the surrounding hotels . I was particularly excited there was a fitness center because I work out on a regular basis and I would not have to give that up on my vacation . Let me start by saying the staff was very rude and I was very dissappointed they could not respect that I was very tired after traveling a very long way . I booked the hotel stay for over a week , which was very expensive , and that seemed to not matter to them at ALL , despite that fact that I was travelling with a small child as well ! They did nothing to accommodate me , and the woman at the front desk even refused rudely to take my calls or answer any questions about nearby restaraunts insisting that even though she worked there she `` did n't know the area '' To tope it all off , the fitness center was under construction so I never got to use it . Worst hotel experience of my life , I will never go back . - Sandy D .

From the moment I stepped into the hotel I felt like I was walking into my own castle and everyone was there to serve me . Checking in was done in a matter of seconds and the receptionists were very friendly . I only had one bag with me but they still insisted on helping me carry it to my room , which I loved since I had just had quite a long flight , and made sure I had everything I needed before wishing me a happy stay in the Hyatt Regency Chicago . After settling in and resting for a while I called room service and ordered some dinner which was provided very quickly and tasted like something out of a 5 star restaurant . Overall my experience was very positive and I would be glad to return to the Hyatt upon my next visit .
1
My husband and I stayed here for a short get-away weekend and loved it . It is so conveniently located close to Navy Pier and Michigan Ave . The staff was very helpful and the room was great . It was definitely worth every penny ! I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago .

I was not at all impressed with my stay at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel Chicago . Checking in there were two people ahead of me but apparently that takes the 1 ( one ! ! ) front desk agent 30 minutes to process . Both guests had issues with their rooms regarding , it seemed , wrong room types and being out of the room type requested . I was nervous about my own reservation and , sure enough , my Superior Corner room was n't available . The hotel tried to compensate me with complimentary breakfast and drinks at the bar but it is still annoying to reserve a room type and not have it be available . I was also annoyed that every little thing has an upcharge at the hotel . Want internet ? Upcharge . Want extra pillows ? Upcharge . Extra coffee for the room ? Upcharge . Bad enough to get that treatment on the airline ride over but to have a hotel nickle and dime you is very annoying and aggravating . I wo n't be back and would strongly recommend other travelers to beware before booking .

I was sorely disappointed with the Sheraton Chicago . From the outside it looks like a great hotel , and I guess the inside was clean enough but the decor was really boring and frumpy , not what I expected when looked at the website . The front desk staff was nice enough at first , but when I asked for the wifi password they told me I had to pay extra . I mean come on , I 'm paying over 200 bucks a night and wifi is EXTRA ? The lady who checked us in got a little snippy about it and said it says so when you make the reservation . ( Note to self , do n't let your husband book a hotel without checking first about what amenities are offeredd . ) So things started off on the wrong foot anyhow . I guess the positives for this hotel are the location and the lakeview ( from some of the rooms ) and it seems pretty safe . Other than that I was not impressed for the price - I 've stayed in big city hotels for half the price that had better linens , a better restaurant , where they got your room cleaned up at a reasonable hour ( we stayed two nights and we did n't get our beds made and fresh towels until almost 5 ) . I guess the most unpleasant thing was the odd smell - not musty per se but maybe like chemicals they use to cover up a mildewy smell . In general it seems lke it 's on the decline and the staff knows it , they 're just kind of lackadaisical . I would n't stay there again .

The atmosphere at this hotel is truly remarkable ; it has a very modern feel . The rooms were very well designed , and the beds are not your average hotel room beds by any means . The pillow top beds made an already relaxed and comfortable stay that much more enjoyable .
1
My stay at the Hotel Monaco recently was fantastic . We got a very reasonable price for our stay ( especially since we were a AAA member ) , and there was plenty of perks to utilize ; in-room spa treatments and an evening wine wine hour to name a few . Another thing that the kids really enjoyed was that , upon request , the staff brought us a fish in its own fishbowl for our room . How cool is that ! The staff were all very helpful and friendly and our stay was very enjoyable . I would definitely recommend the Hotel Monaco to anyone in the downtown Chicago area .

when i first checked the hotel 's website and reviews i was completely sure that it would be a great hotel and i would have a great time there . but i was totally disappointed once i got there , first of all i asked for a nonsmoking room because i hate the odor , and in fact they gave me a non smoking room which smelled worse than a smoking one , it was smelly in a bad way it smelled like sweat and dirty laundry or something like that . then when i was trying to enjoy the view , they windows were all dusty and dirty . so i decided to get out of the room , and i went to the pool and it wasnt what i expected either it has nothing to do with the picture . so i went back to my room and called room service for them to complain about the smell and dirt so they gave me another room which smelled even worse ! . i was about to freak out so they gave me some deodorant and it was tolerable ; the bed was uncomfortable and the bathroom eww ! , its all i can say about this hotel .
1
Hotel is placed in downtown Chicago what makes it really loud , it is hard to sleep during the night because all the `` city '' noises coming from the outside . The rooms in reality are also smaller than they look at at the pictures . I stayed in this hotel for weekend trip with my husband , and we supposed to get room with king size bad , but instead we got , two single beds . The stuff is n't really very nice either , they seems like they make you a favor just by talking to you .

My stay at the Ambassador East Hotel was a pleasant one . I loved being able to take a quick stroll to Michigan Ave for some shopping . I also loved the Pump Room . What a fun place to hang out and enjoy a Blood Mary . The front desk staff was wonderful with my check in since my reservation was lost . They found me a room immediately even though the city was book up . I thought the rooms were clean and well maintained . The shampoo was great and I decided to take it home with me . I am looking forward to another stay at the Ambassador EAst in the spring when I return to Chicago .

My experience at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago was not very pleasant . When we first arrived at the hotel we were greeted by our `` Experience Designer '' who was not the friendliest of people . Also , me and my husband tossed and turned all night on their very uncomfortable bed . For the price , I would have expected a more luxurious experience .

My wife and I spent our honeymoon in Chicago this summer . During this time we stayed that the Hotel Allegro . I knew this would be a positive experience from day one when I actually booked our reservations , the staff was very knowledgeable and courteous , and the whole process was quick , easy , and painless . Upon actually checking in the day of our honeymoon , the customer service was there again the staff again made us feel at home and at ease . The rooms were beautiful and the spa service is excellent . Five Stars and Two Thumbs Up .

I stayed at the Monaco-Chicago back in April . I was in town on business , and the hotel was recommended by a friend of mine . Having spent a weekend there , I have no idea what my friend was talking about . The complimentary morning coffee was weak ; the fitness room was dimly lit ; and I thought I 'd have to have my clothes mailed back to me when I used their supposed `` overnight '' laundry service for a suit I spilled some wine on . My room was adequate , but nowhere near what I 've seen elsewhere at this price point . Recent renovation must be slang for `` everything is stiff and smells of industrial adhesive . '' The mattress in my room was incredibly firm , and I slept poorly . When I travel , I expect an experience similar to or better than my experience at home . At most hotels , I receive excellent service and comfortable accomodations . This was an exception to my usual , and I wo n't be back anytime soon .

We stayed at the Schicago Hilton for 4 days and 3 nights for a conference . I have to say , normally I am very easy going about amenities , cleanliness , and the like ... however our experience at the Hilton was so awful I am taking the time to actually write this review . Truly , DO NOT stay at this hotel . When we arrived in our room , it was clear that the carpet had n't been vacuumed . I figuered , `` okay , it 's just the carpet . '' Until I saw the bathroom ! Although the bathroom had all the superficial indicators of housekeeping having recently cleaned ( i.e. , a paper band across the toilet , paper caps on the drinking glasses , etc. , it was clear that no ACTUAL cleaning took place . There was a spot ( probably urine ! ) on the toilet seat and , I kid you not , the remnants of a lip-smudge on the glass . I know people who have worked many years in the hotel industry and they always warned that lazy housekeeping will make things `` appear '' clean but in fact they make no effort to keep things sanitary . Well , the Hilton was proof . I called downstairs and complained , and they sent up a chambermaid hours later . Frankly , I found the room disgusting . The hotel itself , outside the rooms , was cavernous and unwelcoming , with an awful echo in the lobby area that created a migraine-inducing din . Rarely have I been so eager to leave a place as this . When I got home , I washed all my clothes whether I had worn them or not , such was the skeeviness of our accomodations . Please , do yourself a favor and stay at a CLEAN hotel .

My husband and I came to the Ambassador East Hotel for my sister 's wedding . The hotel had been very helpful and professional in helping us coordinate a wedding with over 200 guests . When we arrived we were impressed by how organized they were , helping us check and get our guests situated . They were even nice enough to let us leave guest gift bags in each of our guest 's rooms . Our rooms were clean and beautifully appointed , with a view of the city . We held the rehearsal dinner/groomsman party in the pump room which has a gorgeous bar complete with celebrity photos on the wall . After my sister was married in a church downtown , we held the reception in the large banquet hall . Again the hotel was great about shuttling all of our guests and helping us arrange dinner , the DJ and all of the wedding 's decorations . We had a great time . Ambassador East Hotel is highly recommended !

My daughter wanted to spend the weekend in Chicago for her 21st birthday recently , and I wanted to find the best hotel for her experience . I looked at the hotel website and really like Hotel Allegro 's insistence in supplying organic fare and in-room spa services , so I booked us for a Friday and Saturday night . Upon arriving , the demeanor of the hotel staff was rude and distant . Not enough to warrant a verbal complaint , but enough to make my daughter and I feel uneasy . After check-in , which took at least 20 minutes due to severe under-staffing , we headed to our room trying to be optimistic . Our room was much smaller than the photos on the hotel site suggested , the sink faucet in the bathroom was leaky enough to make a constantly irritating sound , and we only had a stock of 2 towels , which were never replaced during our stay . We made sure to spend as much time exploring the city as possible just to avoid going back to the hotel . It was a huge disappointment , for me as the customer and for my daughter as the birthday girl . I highly discourage anyone from staying at this hotel . There are much better choices in the Chicago area .

The Palmer House Hilton hotel takes luxury to a whole new level of existence . The rooms are beautifully decorated , with class and superior quality furniture . The hotels restaurant `` lockwood '' consist 's of delicious French and Italian cuisine . The location is in the prime area to downtown , and shopping areas . This hotel is suited for pristine guests , and those who are not willing to settle for less . If you 're looking for not just any stay , but a stay in luxury , you should give The Palmer House Hilton a try . It is one of the best of the best in Chicago , and your stay will be one to remember .

When I planned my summer vacation , I was wanting to travel somewhere new . Chicago was on my mind because of the fast city life . I got in a flight to Chicago and arrived at the Hard Rock Hotel . It was grand and I spent a total of 4 days and nights there . The luxury was exotic and the location was right around the corner from most shopping and dining venues . The room service had me drooling because the food was so delicious , I could hardly picture not feeling satisfied . I met up with a few of my friends and they offered me a tour around town . I enjoyed the stay there and will come back sooner than later .
1
The hotel was very nice ; Service was great , everyone was very friendly . The room was very elegant and classy . The bed was so comfortable . The room also had a flat screen TV and Bose sound system . Not bad . Overall I had a great experience ; with a pleasant staff and perfectly comfortable room , I left here well rested and happy .

MY WIFE AND I STAYED HERE LAST WEEKEND . IT WAS OUR HONEYMOON AND IT WAS WONDERFUL . THIS HOTEL WAS SO BEAUTIFUL INSIDE AND OUT . WE WERE MORE THAN PLEASED WITH OUR ROOM AND THE RESTURANT WAS AMAZING . ALL OF THE STAFF HERE WERE VERY NICE AND POLITE . THEY HELPED US WITH ANY OF OUR NEEDS . I WISH I COULD LIVE IN THIS PLACE . ALL TOGETHER IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST WEEKENDS OF OUR LIVES . WE PLAN ON COMING BACK AGAIN . GREAT HOTEL !

I recently stayed at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park hotel , and it was one of the absolute worse travel experiences that I ever had . One of the main reasons why I had originally booked my stay at the Fairmont was because the property offered special , `` pure '' rooms and suites that are supposed to be hypoallergenic . Because I suffer from extreme allergies -- and I really hate the thought of a less-than-pristine hotel room -- I was happy to pay extra for a room that was supposed to be specially designed for guests with environmental sensitivities . I 'll tell you this right now -- save your money . When I got to my room , I immediately detected the distinct smells of cigarette smoke and mold . To add to the gross factor , I took a look around and noticed dust on the lamps and light fixtures as well as dirt on the carpet . The comforter on the bed looked messy as well -- as if someone had recently used the bed and then hastily threw the comforter back over it . There was no way I was going to stay in this room , so I made my way back to the check-in desk and politely informed them of the problems with my room . The woman at the front desk told me there were no other rooms available and it was only after we practically got into a yelling match that she grudgingly started typing away at her computer . After making me wait for another twenty minutes , she finally informed me that they could put me in another room , but it would be a four hour wait . Four hours ! It was absolutely ridiculous . No hotel -- much less one that constantly touts some sort of promise of superior customer service -- should ever treat any of its customers this way . I do not recommend the Fairmont nor will I ever stay there again .

I had originally chosen the Conrad Chicago Hotel for its location near shopping centers that were within walking distance . However , I later learned that I had made a poor choice . Upon arrival , the lobby seemed nice and we checked in with the clerk . Although , when we reached out hotel room , we were dissapointed in finding it to be a one-bedroom suite . My family went back down to demand another room with two queen-size beds . The clerk , after a twenty minute waiting period , was able to find us a suitable room . Upon entering , the room was noticably hot . We turned on the air conditioning , and after waiting for thirty minutes , the room remained muggy and humid . I called the front desk to complain and ask for a repair man or another room . They promised a repairman within ten minutes . 1 hour later I called again and remined them that the repairman had n't shown up . They once again promised a speedy repair . While waiting , I discovered that our room had no soap and the towels were still damp . I called the front lobby and she said that they were sorry for the inconvenience and that there were some more one the first level , but I had to go get them . After all this trouble , I argued that they should bring it up to me , but in the end , I wound up going to get it myself . After returning to my room and waiting another 30 minutes , the repair man had not shown up . So I called again , and within 5 minutes the repairman came . He managed to fix the air conditioner , but it was about 12am . We were finally able to get some peace and rest well after the room cooled off , but as the night went on , we noticed another problem . The air conditioner began to make wretched screeches and banging sounds . It also emitted a strange odor . Upon checking with the front desk , we demanded another room because it was too late at night to have it repaired . There were not available rooms left , and being so fed up with this hotel 's poor service , we promptly left and checked in at a nearby hotel . I do n't recommend the Conrad Chicago to anyone who wants to enjoy their time .

The Conrad Chicago was by far the best experience I have ever had in travel leisure . Not only was the room beautifully decorated and very comfortable , but the food in the restaurant was exquisite . Not to mention the perfect service from the resort 's employees ! I was very impressed by how quick and caring the staff was of my own personal needs . I 'm naturally a fitness freak , so I was pleased to learn of their massive fitness area on the 11th floor . Best of all , it was available to guests at any time , day or night . The resort was conveniently located by a large shopping area , so it was n't a far walk to scope out the shops . The most memorable part of my stay was looking out at the city after dark and seeing how gorgeous Chicago looks all lit up . It was so relaxing just watching the city come to life . I was very disappointed when I had to pack and leave . Any time that I make my way back to Chicago , you better believe I will be staying at the Conrad Chicago . I recommend this resort to everyone I know who does a lot of traveling .

The Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park has to be one of the most overpriced hotels I have stayed at in a while . At almost $ 500 a night , one would expect . Traveling with my wife , I expected to pay the cost of the room , already being outrageous , but then I was hit with another $ 20 charge for her to stay . Even with a King bed , they only figure in one person to their cost . The beds were average and although there was much to do , everything cost an arm or a leg . It was unbelievable how much they charge for everything and to see people paying it like it was normal blew me away . All in all for the amount of money that I was paying on a per night basis , if I was in Chicago for any longer than that one night , I definitely would have stayed somewhere else . I guess you live and you learn , its just a shame that I had to learn with such a high bill for very average accommodations .

Very beautiful hotel with a wonderful view . The dinning selection is one of the best I have seen in Chicago . I have stayed many places downtown Chicago and nothing matches this . I am a single mother with two children and the concept of having a day care facility on site is just not great for me but for my children as well . The shopping area has great selections right outside of the doors . The biggest thing that I have to say is that the Customer service was great with everything that I needed . I give the hotel a 5 out of 5 .

My fiance and I had taken a trip to Chicago and wanted to stay someplace close to Downtown , so he chose the Amalfi Hotel , located conveniently to everything we needed . This place was phenomenal ! ! ! He chose a romantic getaway package , as we were only in town for a few days and it was the best choice ever . The hotel is super clean and very chic ; the beds are so comfortable and the staff is superb . We were able to bring along our dog , which was also really important to us . The first day we were there , we had gone out during the day with our dog and came back to an in-room couple 's massage . The masseuses come straight to your room so it 's really relaxing and stress-relieving and they were great . After our massages , we went to the Keefer Steakhouse , which the hotel gave us a gift certificate for and the food was fantastic . They do also have a great continental breakfast and we did also eat at the Rocket grill , which was nice as well . In all , our 3 nights there were pretty similar , we went out during the day and had a great time at the hotel while we were there ; I 've recommended this place to a few of my clients going to the Windy City .

My wife and I stayed at the Affinia Chicago last week ( in a studio suite , which was NOT worth the extra payment ) . It was an absolute NIGHTMARE ! To begin with , the room is listed as 'oversized ' , when it 's nothing of the sort . We 've previously stayed in the hotel and the regular guest room is only about 2 square feet smaller . I believe the only extra space was in the closet , which is n't very useful unless you plan on living there ! We had our two sons with us , so we had to make extra sleeping space . Our oldest son slept on the couch and woke up multiple times in the time , complaining of bugs moving around . He must have been umcomfortable also , as I sat on the couch during the day and it was like a rock . The room service is horrible , they took 47 minutes to deliver a pillow for my wife around 10pm , and she had to wait up for that . My family would NEVER go back to this hotel , and I highly recommend you also stay well away .

Conrad Chicago is one of the nicer hotels I have had the pleasure of staying in recently . The rooms were well furnished and brightly lit , but not to the point of garishness . The convenient location was a plus .

My husband and I stay at the Amalfi every year for our anniversary . We just love it ! The service is wonderful and the staff is very friendly . The hotel has very good cuisine options , which are all very tasty ! The hotel is in close proximity to downtown and all the fun things going on there . The rooms are very comfortable and quiet . Perfect for relaxing ! Will definitely keep coming back !

I stayed at the Hilton Chicago back in July . For a `` luxury '' hotel this place did not meet my expectations . For starters , we arrived fifteen minutes early for check in and were told that our room would n't be ready for at least another hour ! I 'm used to hotel rooms being ready well before check-in timee . Since we had to wait we decided to grab a drink at one of the hotel 's restaurants , Kitty O'Sheas . Well , we must have used up almost that whole hour just waiting for drinks . Once we finally got to our room it was OK , although not great for the price . We had no view of anything to speak of even though we had paid for a view , and there were not extra towels as I had requested . We had to call room service twice to receive them , then another two times because our air conditioner was n't working . Fees for internet were ridiculous and the phone service was terrible so I could barely use internet on my phone . Next time I 'm in the Chicago area I wo n't be staying at the Hilton . I 'd only recommend this hotel to people who want to waste money .

I needed a place to stay for a business conference in Chicago . While higher priced , the reviews online plus four stars convinced me . Granted the hotel itself is beautiful , but looks can be deceiving . The pictures online show beautiful white linens but mine were a bit grey . The restaurant ( Cafe Des Architect ) had amazing food , so that was a plus , but the service was awful . I had to wait twenty minutes for a glass of water ! My remote would n't work for the tv and the air conditioner was far too loud . The hotel must 've been hosting a convention because I could hear music all through the night . The housekeeping was good but happened too infrequently . I called twice for more fresh towels . If I wanted this type of experience , I 'd have stayed at a lower-end hotel . Same experience , less money !

My wife and I stayed at the Ambassador East Hotel last month for my son 's wedding . When we got there nobody helped us with our bags and they took forever to Valet our car . After waiting 15 minutes to get my car parked he expected a tip , which I found rude . After finally getting to our room I noticed crumbs on the floor and a dirty bathroom . I was extremely disappointed with the room and the service . I will not recommend this place to anyone .

The Knickerbocker hotel was one of my favorite hotels to visit . My wife and I utilized the park & play package , which gave us an amazing room , complimentary valet service , and a great kit to plan our weekend around . It was well worth the price and we both wish to go back again . The rooms were top notch and the hotel 's staff was excellent . One of the employees , Craig , helped us find our way around the city and this shows the Knickerbocker really cares about its guests . We loved our visit and are sure you will too . A+

I have to admit , I was a little leery about visiting Chicago due to my mild agoraphobia , but after a family member reserved a room at the Hotel Allegro Chicago , my fears were slightly assuaged . A few friends of mine had stayed in this hotel before , and had nothing but positive things to say . With this new-found optimism in mind , I went forward on my journey in confidence . I have to say , I was not let down . From the moment I stepped into the lobby , I felt at home . The concierge called bellboys to move our luggage from the taxi to our rooms , and the check-in process was fast and efficient . The rooms themselves are incredibly homey , feeling less like a hotel room and more like the guest room at a millionaire 's mansion . The high comfort level coupled with prompt service when requesting items such as extra pillows and towels , really helped alleviate my apprehensions about staying in Chicago , and provided a secure place to stay at night , or whenever I did not feel like participating with the group . Of course , the rooms are second only to the overall feel of the hotel . I found myself spending less of my downtime in my room and more of it wandering around the building . Overall it 's very cozy , and has a certain old-world feeling to it , once again lending to it feeling less like a hotel and more like a mansion at times . It was never overwhelmingly crowded , and the people I did encounter were incredibly friendly , yet not intrusive . I do n't usually enjoy staying in hotels , but I love the Allegro Chicago !

Last week , I booked a 'Deluxe Suite ' at the Omni Chicago Hotel for a weekend stay in Chicago . I took the 'Retreat and Relax ' package deal . The wait to check in was intolerably long , because they were letting some people check in with a dog . I 'm allergic to dogs , and I 'm sure its fur and dander got spread all over the room they were in . They insisted on escorting me to to my room , every time I came in , like I was going to break into another guest 's room or something . I swear , anytime I was out of my room they were watching me like hawks , asking me if I needed anything . You know that the only time anyone does that is when they think you 're up to something . I went to the pool , but it was full of screaming children . When I went to bed , I could hear the television in the next room through my wall . And what 's worse , they would n't even let me smoke in the privacy of my room to relieve the stress . They threatened to throw me out on the street , after I gave them hundreds of my hard earned dollars ! I had to go outside -- probably where the dog went to piddle -- to do it . Also , their on-site restaurant is too expensive , given that you 're already paying an arm and a leg for the room . The food should be free ! I would n't stay here again , it was a waste of my money .

This hotel was gorgeous ! I really enjoyed my stay here and will definitely be returning in the future . The staff was friendly , the room was clean , comfortable and very well decorated . The restaurant/ room service was also exceptional . The food was delicious and the room service was prompt . This hotel is also in a great location . It is close to everything anyone may need , such as shopping , food and attractions .

The Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is a nice place to stay if you need a place to stay on quick notice , but it certainly does not `` exceed expectations '' as touted on their website . Their Starpoints system is somewhat complicated and not helpful for the frequent traveler . `` Chic but not fussy '' is an overstatement . The room was clean , although the bed covering was wrinkled and the bathroom counter had water lying on it that appeared as though it had n't been cleaned since the last guest . There was hand lotion and shampoo samples , but no soap sample . The bathroom was short on two towels and it took two calls to housekeeping to get this fixed . `` Cheap '' might have been a better adjective . Check out was simple and not much hassle . Overall , the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers is fine in a pinch , but next time , I will research hotels a little better before making a decision and reserving a room .
1
I would not stay at this hotel again . The rooms had a fowl odor . It seemed as though the carpets have never been cleaned . The neighborhood was also less than desirable . The housekeepers seemed to be snooping around while they were cleaning the rooms . I will say that the front desk staff was friendly albeit slightly dimwitted .

My company was hosting a seminar at the Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel in Chicago , IL . Each participant of the seminar stayed in one of the luxurious rooms at the hotel . My room had an incredible view of downtown Chicago and the styles of the rooms were very modern . My husband was able to stay back in the room and enjoy the large flat screen television while I attended the seminar in one of the hotels meeting rooms . On Saturday night , my company held a ball in the Crystal Ballroom . The food was excellent , the hotel chefs were the best . The servers were polite and were right there to fill up our drinks or bring us more food at the dinner . Our overall stay at Millennium Knickerbocker Hotel will be forever in my memory . It was a fun filled weekend with great food , clean rooms , excellent maid service and all the hotel personnel were polite and willing to fulfill our every need and want ! We will definitely be staying here again !

Although the Architecture of the hotel is quaint , that is about the only positive of this terible hotel . The guest services were unhelpful at best , and the inbuilding resturaunts were unsanitary and untasteful . And as for the rooms , small , cramped , and it seemed as if the sheets had n't been cleaned in the last 5 years . My stay here was distasteful , and I never intend to return , except to ask for my money back .

The Homewood Suites by Hilton , in downtown Chicago , has to be one of the most comfortable and affordable hotels in the windy city . After asking the doorman , I discovered all guest suites in the entire establishment feature a two room layout with a fully equipped kitchen . The full sized refrigerator caused me to do a double take , as did the stove and LCD televisions . This is definitely the place to have a home away from home while in Chicago . It 's mind blowing that a hotel this extravagant can have rates as low as $ 40 a night , which is what I payed when I stayed there in September . The atmosphere was warm and cozy , and the staff were all very friendly and professional .

Extremely disappointed in our stay . This hotel did not look like what pictures portrayed online . I booked online thinking what a perfect place this was going to be , only to arrive and have a room without a view even though that is what was paid for . The room smelled musty and not clean . Garbage was not changed from prior person . Found small ants in bathroom near shower . Called to complain and someone came up 2 hours later and used bug spray . Overall this hotel is in a great location , but we would never visit again . Staff was not overly friendly or helpful and the room was not as all as it seemed online .

The InterContinental Chicago is conveniently located near MIdway airport so the commute was short and easy . The room had a great view of a lake . Room service was available 24 hours a day and the room came with a coffeemaker where you got complimentary coffee and tea which was great I did not have to go out for my morning cup of coffee . There was a business center that had internet , fax machines , and copy machines that was available for use 24 hours a day . One of my favorite things was the fitness center which had masseurs , it was exactly what I needed , very relaxing . The food at the Eno was some of the best I ever ate especially the chocolate , I never wanted to leave . This was a great hotel experience and I would stay there again .

I stayed at Sofitel with my husband for a weekend and I will NEVER be staying again ! The staff was rude , the room was dirty , and the decor is ugly and garish . AVOID at all costs !

I recently made a business trip to Chicago , in which I stayed at the downtown Fairmont hotel . During my visit , I had an aroma-harmony massage . This experience greatly relieved my stress , from all the business meetings I 'd had that day . Candace worked wonders for my neck muscles , especially . This was the only amenity that I sought out , during my trip . My time was very limited . However , the entire staff at this hotel treated me as if I were a valued guest . I 'll definately stay at this hotel again when I 'm in the area . And , I highly recommend the spa !

I booked my weekend Chicago stay at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago because of the location as well as some good reviews I found online . However , my experience at the Hard Rock Hotel fell short of my expectations . When I arrived , well over an hour of check in time , I was told that my room was not yet ready and I was left awkwardly waiting around for another half an hour as I did not want to leave the hotel again before settling in . The hotel staff I interacted with seemed generally uninterested in their jobs , and while I do appreciate that this is a hip hotel popular with a younger crowd , there was an excessive amount of noise on the floor I was staying on throughout the night until about half past four in the morning when it quieted down ( after two calls to the front desk to make complaints about this issue ) . As I am a fairly light sleeper , I woke up several times throughout the night . I would recommend bringing earplugs if you 're also a light sleeper but would like to get in some decent sleep . Overall the hotel looked very nice , but I just felt that my experience was not worth the amount I paid for my room .

My stay at the Affinia last weekend was ideal and I ca n't wait to return . I was in town for a brief personal trip and wanted to have a clean , lovely room near the shopping downtown . Affinia fit the bill . The location was perfect , just one block from the magnificent mile . The decor was modern and sleek , and my room was impeccably clean . They even have a pillow menu ! The price was pretty reasonable , too . I 'll definitely be back .

James Chicago ; the luxurious nice hotel as it was advertised . I did n't want stay in this hotel , but my wife insisted . Ok , so when I booked the ticket , it cost me $ 299 for one room . $ 299 ! I could get a new honeycomb android tablet with dual core processor at that price point ! The room was stylish though , it looked nice . There was a TV , and the beds were fine . Although I could n't quite understand why they had Wifi and no computer . Why would I even need wifi if there is no computer ? What were they thinking ! ? The experience I had with James Chicago was a bit below of what I had expected . I mean the food available there was n't very tasty at all . I had to wait in a long line to get the ticket and I was also hoping to browse the internet , but they had no computer , only wifi . That 's like only having bread , without any fillings to make it into a sandwich !

My husband and I recently chose the Palmer House Hilton for a rare couple 's getaway from our usual life , and an escape it truly provided . There is something to be said for all the modern amenities combined with an aesthetic drawn from a grander and more luxurious time , let alone with ever-elusive accessibility for a wheelchair user ! A bonus was that we did not need to feel like we must lug half our usual household with us , because things like alarm clocks , hairdryers and ironing boards were already there , electronic media even available for rent . With a comfortable bed , control over how the room felt , no need to search elsewhere for coffee and excellent room service at our beck and call , we had to remind ourselves that we had planned to leave our room to take advantage of all the Chicago culture in close proximity . Too often a hotel is an overpriced way to get out of making your own bed in the morning , but the Hilton was a true vacation . Thank you .

The Talbott Hotel claims to be Chicago 's Premiere Small Luxury Hotel . After staying there and experiencing the service , environment , and the hotel in general , I can say with confidence that this just is n't true . I arrived with rather high expectations due to the claims made by the hotel and some of the reviews posted on their website and I was immediately disappointed . No one came to my car to collect my bags and I was forced to lug them inside myself . The doorman was polite but failed to even open the door for me , leaving me to fend for myself while trying to carry my bags . Once inside , the atmosphere was not what I expected . The lighting was poor , leaving the lobby dark and it looked like a dingy setting with a glossy veneer in an attempt to hide the degenerate state of the building . The carpet looked dirty , as if it had n't been vacuumed or washed in quite some time , and up in the corners where the walls met the ceilings there was visible water damage . When I arrived at the front desk , I was forced to wait over five minutes until someone came out to help me . After checking in I went up to my room and was once again disappointed . The bed was very uncomfortable and I ran the shower for ten minutes without ever receiving any hot water . That night I ordered room service . The food took 45 minutes to get to my room , and when it finally arrived it was cold . The fitness center had a very small selection of machines which caused long lines while waiting to use them . I would certainly not recommend this hotel to any of my friends , and probably not to my enemies either . Stay away !

The Amalfi Hotel Chicago portrayed itself to be a luxurious comfortable place to stay . When arriving at the hotel my party and I had over a 20 minute wait just to check in . We were treated like cattle once we were able to check in at their `` private '' counter that their website highlights . It felt as though I was sitting with a bank teller rather than checking in . Not only did the wait and process take seemingly forever , but our reservations were completely wrong . I ended up having to settle for a double non-smoking room when I had reserved a smoking king room . Not having the room I requested and was assured was available is completely unacceptable for the high prices of this supposedly high end luxurious hotel . I was not compensated for having to switch rooms and Audrey our Experience Designer was no help at all even when we called down upon entering the room which smelled of urine and stale booze . I recommend saving a handful of money and checking into a chain hotel in the area . The Amalfi Hotel Chicago is a waste of time and money as far as I am concerned especially when I could stay at a cheaper chain hotel and get better treatment and comfort . Do n't waist your time staying here .

We decided to stay at The James last weekend with our kids . We reserved the `` Family Adventurer with Paul Frank '' . It 's a special offer by the hotel to entice visitors to see the local museums and aquarium . We ended up receiving 2 Chicago City Passes , which ultimately paid for themselves and 4 tickets for the Chicago Children 's Museum . My kids had a ball . We ended the day with a milk and cookies turn down service and a special pair of pajamas that my daughter adored . All in all , a great weekend where my kids were the focus . The adults certainly were n't forgotten since we had a great breakfast in the room the next morning .

My husband and I had a wonderful time at Swissotel Chicago , when my husband went for a trade fair . We got a classic double room for two nights and it was definitely worth the money . Clean and comfortable , chic and new fixtures . The view of the pier was magnificent . Staff were most helpful and prompt when we requested extra towels and pillow . It 's right next to riverside restaurants and river is very pretty .

I just spent the weekend here with my wife , and she loved it as much as I do . I was here several weeks ago for a work trip booked by the company to show our staff off to some big clients , so I did n't have any choice . But when my wife said she wanted to come to Chicago , I knew this was the place to take her . The hotel has n't just been remodeled , it 's been completely redesigned . Things have been moved around to make the flow of the public spaces work better , and the two rooms that I 've seen are showplaces . They are amazing . This hotel is part of a luxury chain , and it 's easy to see why . They offer full room service at convenient hours . I 've been in every eating area now , and they are all great , too . Whether for business or pleasure , you ca n't beat this . It 's a luxury hotel with all the luxurious features you 'd expect . My wife was stunned , and yours will be , too .

I stayed at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers on a recent trip to Chicago , and had a great stay . The rooms were beautiful , the beds comfortable , and the views of the city were fantastic . My room overlooked the river and the city . I felt like I was on a luxury vacation . The hotel has a few different restaurants . I ate at the Chicago Burger Company , which was delicious . The burgers were juicy , and the prices were great . The indoor pool was a great way for me to relax and entertain the kids in between sightseeing activities . Overall , I had a wonderful stay .

Fantastic stay ! The hotel was beautifully decorated and immaculately clean . I chose this place because a friend recommended it plus it was VERY close to my business conference . Here you get the resources and exemplary four star luxury treatment with the downtown Chicago charm . Be sure to try the ribs at South Water Kitchen next door . They are the best I 've ever had . EVER ! If youre in the mood to unwind , you can sample the evening wine tastings downstairs or take a walk and explore the nightlife all around . I had a great time here . From now on , I wo n't stay anyplace else .

I was really expecting a lot more from a quality chain like the Sheraton , but a recent stay at their downtown location in Chicago was somewhat of a disappointment . It started with check in ; I had specifically requested a room with a single king-size bed , but was told at the front desk in no uncertain terms ( OK , rather rudely ! ) that because of some banker 's convention that was going on , I should be happy with the double-bed room that was left . It was all I could do to get a lousy drink voucher for my inconvenience ! The room itself was OK , nothing special though . The cleaning staff must 've just been through , because there was a faint aroma of old washrags still in the air . The internet jack was n't working . It took more than two hours for a maintenance guy to come up to fix it , no apologies given . For the price , I really expected more in the way of customer service from Sheraton . I guess they 're really no better than anyone else these days !

We recently completed our first visit to Chicago and were pleasantly surprised by the Affinia Chicago hotel where we stayed . The hotel has gone to great lengths to offer extra services to their guests , including individual pillow choices , complimentary kits with items designed to enhance the city visit , and fine dining in two on-site restaurants , one of them roof-top with amazing city views . I would recommend this hotel to anyone visiting Chicago .

I have to say that the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago is a cool place to stay . When I first got there , getting checked in was very fast . The lady at the counter was nice and well spoken . The bellhop had out bags into the room very fast . The room was very hip and cool . There was musical items all over the place . I really loved the Beatles art that was in my bathroom . After being in the room a few minutes , I got a call from the front desk asking me if I liked my room . They also asked me if I would be interested in things like spa treatments and or if I needed to use their business room . I needed some things shipped while I was there , which they had supplies to help me with that . After getting some work done , I called the concierge if there was some really good pizza places around . They gave me information for 3 awesome places . I left and came back after having a night out on the town . They were very understanding that I was a wee bit out of it . I had more than pizza that night if you get my drift . When I got back to my room , the bed was so comfortable . I feel right off to sleep and had a good nights sleep . In the morning I order breakfast , which was really a Philly cheese steak . They will make anything you want anytime of day . I checked out by 9am with my bags feeling rested and very relaxed . Thank You Hard Rock , You Rock !

I was very disappointed with this hotel . The front desk clerk was rude ; she was on a personal call and took 10 mins . to get off the phone . When I arrived in the room the bed was n't made from the last guest and all the towels were dirty . I called down to the front desk and she made me come back down from the twelveth floor for a new room assignment ( on the twelveth floor ) . Once downstairs the clerk treated me as though I had done something wrong . When I arrived in the new room I found the bathroom less than clean ... There was hair all over the floor , toilet and shower . The shower curtain was mildewed and dried toothpaste spit on the mirror . My allergies started to bother me , immediately upon entering the room , so I checked the filter in the air conditioner . Which looked like it had never been cleaned.The comforter was stained and the carpet looked like it never saw a vacuum . While waiting on acceptable room I went to dinner . Which proved to be as bad as the rooms . The lettuce in my salad was brown and slimmy . The steak was rare and I asked for medium . Not to mention , it tasted like rotten meat.The veggies looked like they had been cooked a week earlier and the potato was shriveled and dry . To top the whole experience off ... When I went to turn on the lamp in my final room it electrocuted and the ambulance had to come get me for a 2 day hospital stay .

This hotel is beautiful , it is very modern and has a very luxuary feel to it . The location is wonderful , it is close to magnificent mile and the Navy pier , which was a great place to show the children on our vacation . We had the option of private parking which made a feel secure with our car , and the valet was very nice and helpful . I also take my work with me everywhere I go , So the wi-fi at the hotel was a-plus . They have a wide selection of packages that can include anything from the couple that wants to get away or a family outing . This place is great for the price , due to the looks of the hotel you will be surprised at how affordable it is . This is very nice place and it gives you a feeling of being the queen or king for the duration of your stay .

The staff at the Talbott hotel was completely unresponsive when I told them there were a bunch of drunken teenagers playing ding , dong , ditch . The sheets smelled funny when I arrived and were only changed 6 times during my two-week stay . The room service was very slow and the cleaning crew did not replace my soap , but I did notice the contents of the mini-bar diminished every time the maid service had been in my room .

My wife and me stayed in the Amalfi Hotel Chicago last August in a weekend visit to Chicago . The hotel is located in the 20 W Kinzie St , in the well-known River North District . We got what the hotel promised : gentle staff , a luxury room with a breathtaking view , magnificent meals and a select wine . I also used its well-equipped gymnasium . We paid $ 586 with taxes for two nights . I think it was a good price , taking in account the excellent conditions we got there . I would recommend the Amalfi Hotel to anybody with good taste that visits Chicago .

Last month , my husband and I stayed at the InterContinental Chicago while we were in town for IMTS . Although they were very busy , the service was excellent and very professional . The staff were always smiling and happy to help . InterContinental was conveniently located near Michigan avenue , and the best stores and restaurants in town . The view from our room was great ! Our room was always clean when we arrived home at night , it was decorated nicely , and the beds were extremely comfortable ! We ate at the hotel 's restaurant Zest , and the food was great ! It was by far one of the best hotels we have visited in a while . We will definitely be back !

My stay at The Palmer House Hilton was less than satisfactory . I would have expected much for from such a `` high end '' hotel . The rooms were way over priced , and the service was less than satisfactory . At one point , I left my dirty towels on the floor to be picked up , and when room service came through , they were still there ! On the other side of things , the cup I had left on my desk ( which I was planning to use later ) was gone . My coffee and my towels were also never replaced . I also was astounded that internet service did not come with the price of the room . Rather , it was a `` nominal fee '' . After paying so much for a room , I had hoped to at least have complimentary wifi . My stay at the Palmer House Hilton left much to be wished for . I will not be staying there again .

The Chicago Palmer House disappointed me . I chose it because it a Hilton hotel , but it definitely does not live up to the standard set by this name . My first impression was a negative one when I was greeted by a rather rude staff . My room might have been luxurious years ago , but the general impression was that it had not been cleaned regularly and could use a little freshening . The bathroom was obviously newer but the shower was difficult to use and the water pressure was absolutely horrible . The food served by the room service and at the hotel 's restaurant sounded delicious on the carefully crafted menus , and the high prices made me expect delicate cuisine . The food simply did not deliver its promises . Everything tasted very bland and the portions were ridiculously small . The location of the hotel might seem like an advantage , since it is in downtown Chicago nearby many touristic attractions : however , the windows in my room did not protect me from the constant noise of cars going by . Overall , this hotel would be decent if it did not advertise itself as a luxury hotel and did not use the Hilton name and price range .

We enjoyed our stay at the Swissotel in downtown Chicago . It was elegant , classy , and the service was impeccable . It was very family friendly for us , with the spacious rooms , the kid 's room , and the no smoking policy . We were just a short walk away from shopping and entertainment and the whole family enjoyed the virtual city tour that helped us decide what we wanted to see . The food was delicious and we did n't have to go outside the hotel to find good food . When visiting Chicago again , we will come back . It was a luxurious experience at a reasonable price .

I went to the Homewood Suites in Chicago which is part of Hilton 's famous hotels . I got ta say that this is the worst hotel that I have ever been to . In fact , Homewood Suites is the worst hotel on the face of this planet . I checked out the rooms and their rooms look like the hotel was built in bad shape . In fact , the rooms looked so bad that I wanted to leave the hotel early . I also got to check out the employees who worked for this hotel . I saw one of the employees and when I rung the bell for my room , they ignored me . How could a hotel have the worst service when they are supposed to not ignore you ? One more thing that I hate about this hotel is that the logo did n't look like the actual logo . It looked more like the logo was changed to look more like something a baby could draw . I 'll never go to this hotel again and it wo n't even be in a million years for that matter . This is a hotel that I will never recommend to anyone because of everything the hotel has to offer .

Having traveled to Chicago on business once before , I was looking forward to spending some vacation time in the city and wanted to have the best accommodations for my trip . After some research , I decided that the Palmer House Hilton sounded like the perfect place to stay . And , in a way , it was perfect -- perfectly awful . After reading some positive reviews and checking out the hotel 's website , I was expecting a luxury room that was a notch above the ordinary . However , my standard guest room , which the hotel 's website describes as `` deluxe , '' was very bland and generic and reminded me of rooms I had stayed in at budget chain hotels , not pricier historic hotels , such as this one . The carpeting looked dingy , so I had to wear shoes or slippers any time I walked on it and there was a gap in the curtains that made it impossible to block out the sunlight in the morning -- or the horrendous view of a brick wall that I had from my window . In addition , the sink in the bathroom dripped constantly and was an annoyance all night long . Everything cost extra , including the gym , the pool and the spa , and the restaurant prices were outrageous . This hotel is overpriced , overrated and definitely subpar . I would n't recommend it to my worst enemy .

Located right in the heart of downtown Chicago i visited this hotel on a business trip . The first things i noticed was how friendly the staff is , and how clean the rooms are ( even compared to other luxury hotels ) seeing as i had a night layover before my meeting i decided to stop by the Terrace and get a drink , i got a mojito and i must say i was very impressed , i 've had my share of mojitos and it was one of the better ones , once i retired back to my room i found the sound system to be excellent , bed was soft and the TV did n't appear burned out at all . Overall i give this a five out of five , the staff was helpful and friendly the whole time and the atmosphere was perfect , i wish i could have stayed longer .

The Hyatt Regency Chicago basically caters to guests who want to feel like they 're staying in a Nice Hotel as soon as they enter the lobby . In other words , come here for the looks , not the amenities . They make a big deal out of the fact that their bedsheets undergo a special de-germifying process ... . you know , because a simple washing machine just is n't good enough . To me , this sort of thing appeals to folks who enjoy being picky and narcissistic because they identify these traits with being `` rich '' -- which most of them are not . Meanwhile , the hotel does n't even offer free wireless -- an essential feature for business travelers like me . Obviously I 'm not the intended consumer , though , so I guess I should n't be surprised .

This has been one of the most pleasurable hotels Ive ever stayed at . From the beautiful concourse to the amazing food , Amalfi really exceeds its standards . The in-room spa service was so relaxing and the tang of the wine was incredible . I highly recommend this hotel as I will give my stay a 5/5 stars .

Wow ! Loved the Ambassador East Hotel in Chicago ! It was so close to all the great sights of Chicago like Navy Pier , Lake Michigan , and all the fabulous dining . The hotel was very classy and the rooms were furnished in a traditional , but cozy manner . The entire family loved it , even the dog ... because they are also pet friendly at the Ambassador East Hotel ! We loved the restaurant there , the Pump Room was great , something to please even the pickiest of our eaters . We were there on a family get-away , but asked to see a larger `` suite '' . The suites were gorgeous . I ca n't wait to tell our friends about this place ! Our next business trip to Chicago , we are booking at this hotel . They have the perfect conference rooms and we LOVE the service ! We are definitely coming back !

My family and I were in Chicago for a friend 's wedding . We had asked around to find a hotel that was nice , but affordable and were pointed in the direction of the InterContinental Chicago hotel . The hotel appeared very nice , and to have all the amenities : Room service , WiFi , clean rooms . Unfortunately , as it turned out , appearances can be deceiving . It begins at the desk , where the clerk was downright rude and uncaring . He said they did n't have any rooms available because we did n't make arrangements . It was getting late , and we had no place to go , there were n't any hotels nearby and my kids were starving . I asked if there was anything he could do , and he said that I will have to ask someone else because he was busy . I talked with his manager and after a bit of fussing , the manager apologized and moved us into a room for the night . Apparently , our expectations for what would be the normal amenities for a hotel stay was above standard , because this room was n't even clean and the wifi did n't work . We ordered room service , and it never came , even after several complaints . It does n't end there either ; when we got home we found that the hotel had charged us for the room service . Overall , this was a very frustrating experience , and I would n't stay there again .

From the moment I stepped into the Ambassador East Hotel , I was very much impressed ! ! The entire staff was extremely helpful and very pleasant . The bell staff escorted my husband and I right up to our suite . Our suite was beyond belief . The atmosphere was very classy and romantic . My husband previously arranged for a bottle of champagne to be waiting in our room when we arrived . We had traveled to Chicago , from New York , for a romantic weekend get away . We had dinner that night at the hotel restaurant , The Pump House , and were very pleased . Dinner started with soup and a salad , main course meal and dessert , all for a reasonable price . We did a little local shopping the next day , after a very well rested night in their wonderfully comfortable king sized beds . Every interaction with the staff was a postitive experience . We enjoyed our weekend get away and would most definitely return to the Ambassador East Hotel the next time that we are in Chicago , Illinois . 5 stars ... .

As I walked into the hotel I was greeted warm heartedly . They took my information from me in an efficient manner and got me to my room quickly . I was very pleased to see that my bed was laid out perfectly and that there was plenty of towels in the bathroom . Also , I was happy to see that the shampoo and soap provided was sufficient . Overall , I was very happy with my stay at this hotel .

When I was asked to stay at the Swissotel in Chicago , I immediately went to their website to check them out . What I found there was decent , nothing really stood out . It was n't until I actually went there that my eyes were opened . The amazing customer service I received there was exceptional . Every whim and detail I asked for they helped me perfectly . The room was neatly fixed when I arrived and was cleaned every day . When I asked about more towels , the maids were happy to help me out . If I were ever to be in that area again , I know exactly where I 'm staying , the Swissotel .

The Affinia hotel in Chicago was superb . the room service was exemplary and the food , I do n't even know were to start . The chef obviously knew what he was doing , I especially loved the seafood , my personal favorite was the shrimp . Aside from this , I loved how beautiful the hotel was . It is definetly a bargain for the price , for that price you would probably get a good 3 star hotel but , I felt as if i was in a $ 10,000 a night 5 star hotel in the Europe . great bang for your buck . Would recommend it to anybody looking to relax at a great hotel with great amenities in a great city . My friends actually went their a while back because of me . They loved it ! I know you will too .

The Chicago Hilton is a great hotel our stay there was fantastic . The hotel is placed in the heart of the city were you can find it a easy walk to almost everything from the local colleges to the great restaurant that surround the city . The room itself was clean and the staff was fun and helpful . I ca n't really say anything bad about this place it was a great time and a great place to stay while we were there .

My recent stay at the Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park was everything I desired and more for my luxury shopping weekend in Chicago . I loved the contemporary style of the rooms complete with modern conveniences like a 42 inch flat screen television and iPod docking station . I appreciated the walking distance to all of Chicago 's premiere shopping areas . The concierge was extremely helpful in booking dinner reservations , while the bellman was excellent at providing me with private car service . The services I received at at mySpa were some of the best in the world . Dinner at aria restaurant was delicious . In short , Fairmont Chicago Millennium Park was the perfect luxury vacation , meeting all my needs and more !

Amalfi Hotel Chicago has several factors that make it one of the best hotels in the chicago area and an experience you will not forget in a long time . Its proximity to some of the best spots in Chicago makes it a visitor 's delight . It is close to the Magnificient Mile which is the shopping area , it is also close to the Loop , Merchandise Mart and Michigan Avenue making it a fantastic location with great layout and it has lots of space . Each guest room includes a flat screen HD TV . The beautiful reception has free snacks and drinks even as the hotel provides free breakfast . The 24-hour fitness centre is always open for business.The hotel has a no-smoking policy . It also has free internet facilities , room service , Air conditioning , laundry/drycleaning , multilingual staff to make communication easy , spa services , heating , conference facilities , satelite tv , brailed elevators and pets are allowed . The Concierge desk offer the best wine available and I must add that the wine is great . The hotel prides itself in making you feel like royalty . The staff are very pleasant and the door men are always willing to lend a hand . The hotel places priority on cleanliness as the rooms are always clean . The hotel makes it possible for you to relax , go shopping in the best stores which are close-by , eat in some of the best restaurants and party in clubs most of which they have entered into some form patnership . They offer great deals for every type of customer . I would definitely recommend this place .

I was going to Chicago last month and wanted a nice hotel that was close to restaurants and shops . I did some research and believed the InterContinental would suit my needs . I sure was not disappointed by my decision ! This hotel lots of historic charm . Despite being a larger hotel , the service was top shelf ! The rooms , while not large by any means , were extremely well-appointed and very comfortable . My kids loved the big swimming pool that the hotel offered . As for me , I was more impressed with the location to the Magnificent Mile . The hotel also has a nice restaurant on-site . The food was very good and , just like the hotel itself , the restaurant provided perfect customer service . Dollar for dollar , the InterContinental in Chicago is a great deal and I will be staying there again .

This hotel was worth every cent . You have not experienced Chicago luxury until you have stayed here . In town for a conference , my colleagues and I never had to leave our hotel for much of anything . Fine dining , entertainment , you name it : Knickerbocker 's got it ! I will definitely return as my wife and I frequent Chicago to visit family .

I recently stayed at the Hard Rock Hotel in Chicago , Il . From the start , the experience was bad . The room was filthy , there were no towels , and the front desk did nothing to rectify the situation . I will never stay there again . I could not have been more dissatisfied .

For our anniversary this year , my wife and I stayed at the Conrad . We 're from the suburbs , so staying at a nice hotel in the city is a big deal for us . It 's expensive , so we expect the best for our money . This was most definitely not the best for our money . It was n't even a good deal either . The problems began right off the bat . When we got to our room , we were both greeted by a musty smell that seemed to hang throughout the entirety of the room . It was like walking into a dusty attic . When I sat down to watch TV , it turns out it was n't even connected to cable or anything . I kept changing the channel , but it was nothing but static and white noise . I even looked for another remote . After we left our things , we went out for a night in Chicago , but coming back , the smell seemed to have gotten worse . I finally asked the hotel management to come up to our rooms . They moved us to a different room , but they had no explanation for the smell . For a single stay , that was more trouble than it was worth .
1
I recently stayed at the Hyatt Regency in Chicago , IL , and boy was I surprised . The hotel looks nice from the outside but the smell from the river is noxious . In fact , the smell was so bad one night that it almost made it difficult to sleep or even think of eating . As if this were not enough , the bathroom of my room looked like it had n't been cleaned in a month and their were stains on the `` fresh '' towels . Towards the end of my stay I saw a mouse on the ground floor and could only imagine what other critters may be lurking in the walls .

Fantastic Hotel ! Upscale and luxurious , and in a great location ! Rooms are spacious and comfortable and the staff goes out of their way to treat guests like royalty ! The rooms are tastefully decorated and very clean , the beds are comfortable and even the bathrooms were to die for ! My husband and I had a great time in the lounge and enjoyed many of the amenities . I would definitely recommend this hotel to everyone , and ca n't wait to get back there myself !

I want everyone to know about the awful experience I had at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers . When we arrived at the hotel , the clerk who was checking us in said that our reservation was not in the system ( I had called earlier in the day and confirmed it ) . After speaking to the on-duty manager we were informed that our reservation had been canceled earlier in the day and that the hotel was now completely booked . We later found out that there was a convention at the hotel and that the price for the rooms had risen dramatically . I believe they canceled our reservation just so they could make more money . I for one wo n't be going back to this hotel !
1
This hotel is dizzying with all of the bold colors and patterns everywhere . It smells because pets are allowed . This hotel is also extremely dirty because of the pets allowed . There was mold in our room and bathroom , pet hair everywhere ! Kids love pools . How can they claim to be kid friendly without one ? My kid was bored . The food was basically the same every day , no variation in the menu . Pictures on their website of the rooms must be reserved for their `` travel club '' because our room did n't even remotely resemble the pictures . They did the old bait and switch . We reserved a `` family room '' . When we opened the door of our room , we realized that it was n't what the website pictured or had what the website described . We kept our mouths shut for fear of retaliation by the hotel workers . Definitely do not recommend this hotel ! ! !

My family chose to stay at the Chicago Hilton during our last trip to the city . We wanted something luxurious and centrally-located without having to pay exorbitant prices . I can honestly say we made an excellent decision in picking the Hilton . The staff treated us well , the rooms were clean and roomy ( we loved the Serenity beds ) , and the hotel itself is stunning . It was like stepping back in time . We loved that the Chicago Hilton was close to numerous attractions . The weather was lovely , so it was great to walk to Navy Pier , Sears Tower , and the Adler Planetarium . We will definitely stay at the Hilton the next time we are in Chicago .

My husband and me reserved a room online for the Chicago Hilton . We were looking for a quit few days away from home and work . Unfortunately what we found was not what we were looking for . First of all the room was smaller than what it appears to be online in the photos . The floors looked like they have n't been cleaned in a while in the check in area . The room we stayed in had very thin walls and we could hear the conversation of the other guest on each side . The staff was horrible . We had asked for a turn down service it was never received . I would not at all recommend this hotel to anyone . Chicago is a great place to visit as long as you do not stay at the Hilton .

I went to stay at this hotel last year . I have got to say it was a great authentic experience , the dining Restaurant was clean and fantastic the rooms were very comfortable with a friendly staff . Its location could n't be more perfect so close you can walk to do some shopping . Looking at it from the outside at night is very beautiful . It is very affordable . I recommend this place to anyone and plan on staying again the next time i come to town .

Hotel is located 1/2 mile from the train station which is quite hike when you 're traveling with luggage and/or kids . They seem to cash in on guests who arrive in private car by charging exorbitant parking/valet fees . Rooms feature either double or king sized beds ; no queen beds at all . If you want a little extra leg room in your bed , the price jump from double- to king-sized is stiff . Rooms with any kind of view pay a healthy surcharge , too .

Upon entering the Hotel Monaco CHicago , i could see the beauty of a classically elegant building . The old fashioned furnishings , the wonderful view , and the polished wood decorating the entore hotel . At first i had been skeptical , but any doubts i had carried into the hotel were gone . As i entered my room , the fresh flowers and the amazing Chicago view greeted me . During my stay i enjoyed my free time lounging by the pool , winding down every night with a comforting massage . I would recommend this hotel not only for the pure elegance , but for the wonderful customer service and the fantastic amenities .

The Intercontinental Chicago Magnificent Mile The outside of the hotel itself is as the name says is pretty magnificent despite being set in what has to be the filthiest section in the city . For the cost of the rooms starting at 179.00 a night , you would think they would have a competent parking attendant . I was delayed from a very important client due to a latency issue with my reserved room , and if that was not enough . To top it off the room service had the nerve to bring up room temperature pasta and a bottle of champagne that had the seal previously broken free of the cork . Needless to say this will be the last time this hotel ever is to grace so much as another dollar bill from my account . I would highly recommend another hotel with better accommodations .
1
The location of this hotel was superb ! Our room was spacious and the view was spectacular . The staff at the hotel treated my family with the upmost respect . One of the front desk staff even helped my five year old tie his shoes while we were waiting for the porter . We will stay here again and advise our friends to do the same .

Me and my business associate had a job in Chicago and wanted to stay somewhere that had more features . We did some research online and came across the Hotel Moncaco . We decided to stay for 3 nights . When we arrived we noticed that it was in a busy part of the city with bright lights . The staff was upstiff , and did n't not offer much hospitality . Our room did have a view , but of the city lights and kept our room bright , even with the curtains closed . The beds appeared soft , but did not offer much comfort . For what we paid , we expected more .

I was not pleased with my recent stay at the Palmer House Hilton . My room was not ready upon my arrival and the room I was given was not what I had requested . I had requested a room with 2 queen size beds on a lower floor and was not given that . The air conditioning in my room was not functioning properly and it could not be turned off . The room had an overpowering fragrance smell which made my sinuses act up . I wondered what had happened in the room before I got it to make the housekeeping staff use so much air freshener . There was no doorman available or a cart so I had to lug my 3 suitcases by myself by dragging 2 of them about 20 feet and then going to get the other one so as not to lose sight of them at any point since they contained valuable irreplaceable items . Luckily another guest saw my predicament and offered assistance . My room had evidence of the previous occupants that had been left behind and overlooked by the housekeeping staff . They promised to send someone up to take care of the debris and after 3 calls to the front desk I finally gave up . I had looked forward to my stay there but have to conclude that it simply did not live up to the advertising and was a poor value for the money that I spent to stay there .

The Omni Chicago Hotel offers all the great amenities in comfort that is expected of a luxury hotel , particularly speedy and easy wireless internet access and nice-sized plasma tv 's . The windows are big enough to give a spectacular view of the city skyline while reclining on a great sofa in a comfortable and luxurious living room , before sleeping in a king-sized bed of either feather or foam pillows , which is particularly relaxing after taking a bath or shower in the spacious bathroom . An in-room massage appointment will add an additional relaxing aspect to the stay . There 's even an exercise kit within the room for extra convince . However , the vast fitness center is just as worthy to use , as well as the whirlpool , Jacuzzi and the indoor swimming pool . Sunbathing is an easy activity to achieve via the two rooftop sundecks . A nice aspect that is n't so common to find is the ability to have small pets stay with you in the hotel . The Omni Chicago is a great way to add a bit of luxury to any type of vacation , particularly when you do n't want to be separated from your pet , within the area .

I stayed for four nights while attending a conference . The hotel is in a great spot - easy walk to Michigan Ave shopping or Rush St. , but just off the busy streets . The room I had was spacious , and very well-appointed . The staff was friendly , and the fitness center , while not huge , was well-equipped and clean . I 've stayed at a number of hotels in Chicago , and this one is my favorite . Internet was n't free , but at $ 10 for 24 hours is cheaper than most business hotels , and it worked very well .

we love the location and proximity to everything . The staff was very friendly and courteous . They were so nice to our 2.5 year old boy . got his backpack full of goodies the moment we arrived . We got free wifi and morning drinks by signing up for select guest program . Ca n't beat that ! the only minor issue is the elevator . we have to take 2 separate elevator trips to get to our room . It got a little annoying when we were going in and out often . Otherwise , it was a great stay !

I want to issue a travel-warning to folks who might sign up for the weekend deal they offer through travelzoo from time to time : The deal says `` free breakfast '' included in the price . However , what they do n't tell you , is that the breakfast consists of a cup of coffee and a bisquit ( or two ) ! Moreover , you need to ask for these `` tickets '' at the lobby when you check in - they wo n't give them to you automatically ! We stayed there over Christmas '03 , and we , and I noticed several guests who bought the same package , had a rather unpleasant experience ! The hotel is nice though , if you do n't consider their lousy service !

Just got back from three nights at the Knickerbocker . Went up to Chicago for some last minute Christmas shopping . Hotel is in a great location . North end of Michigan Ave. about half a block away . Staff was very nice and professional . Everyone we came in contact with was very helpful . Granted this is a older hotel and some of the rooms are no bigger than closets . We were booked into a standard room and when we arrived we upgraded to a deluxe room . Good size room , with nice furnishings and a comfortable bed . Bathroom was somewhat small . Housekeeping did a great job cleaning the room every day . Did not eat at the restaurant Nix , but saw several people getting orders delivered to the bar . Overheard comments saying the food was very good . Drink service at the Martini Bar can be slow . Martinis run $ 9 and up . Very good drinks and they do n't shy away from the liquor . Valet parking was $ 35 a day with in/out priviliges . Overall a great stay . Would definately stay at this hotel in the future .

My family and I stayed at this hotel during an extended weekend trip in July , 08 . We had ( 3 ) 1 bedroom suites . Great Location in downtown Chicago . Within walking distance to shopping and most downtown tourist attractions . The service was excellent and the hotel staff was friendly . The breakfast buffet was very good but the eating area can get crowded . I recommend going early . The rooms were quiet and clean . I highly recommend this hotel for families and for travelers staying > 2-3 days . We would stay here again . Parking is expensive , about $ 28/day . It is valet . The cheapest self parking I could find in the area was $ 24/days so we did valet parking . The valet and bell staff were very helpful and friendly . This is my 3rd experience with Homewood Suites ( 3 different cities ) . I have had a great experience each time .

i valeted my lexus and it was returned with a smashed side mirror . They admitted it was their fault , and now they wo n't pay the $ 500 to fix it because we ca n't prove it was not broken before ! ! ! the hotel is wonderful , the rooms are new and nice , but we will never stay here again because of this ... .Be sure to inspect your car before you leave !

great expectations from the hotel of THE FUGITIVE ! Wonderful lobby ! AND THAT 'S IT ! The room was old in style and furnitures , the tv was from the other century , no minibar , no wireless internet , no wireless adapter enough for the number of the room , those guys ignore that we are in the era of IPAD without cable connections . small room , small bathroom , rude service room . they have lost my credit card number and want CASH ON DELIVERY for a breakfast of 20 dollars . Robbery in the business center , 0,59 cents a MINUTE for internet connection , you have to pay to use word , or excel . NEVER AGAIN !

Named my price on priceline . $ 50.00 Bucks . Hotel room was great . Clean , Clean and new . Fresh crisp sheets , comfortable bed , flat screen TV , clean carpet , nice bath , etc . Short distance to food and sightseeing . I highly recommend this property . Be prepared to pay over $ 40.00 per night to park . Hey , Its a hyatt . They also charge $ 5.00 for a bottle of water that is normally a buck . For a total of $ 100.00 nightly stay in Chicago this place is it just do n't drink the bottled water . Happy Travels

I never write these reviews , but felt that it was important to state that this hotel should not be the # 1 2008 travelers choice . Terrible Service , Lazy Doormen/bellmen/concierge/valet , Lack of Respect , allow dogs to bark all morning after multiple complaints , Phantom charges to room , front dest at checkout and checkin were pompus . The icing on the cake was me watching the doormen stand and watch while a father tried to open a door to push his stroller through with his infant son , and the doorman watched on doing nothing . Me and my girlfriend are young , look young in how we dress , but in all honesty make more money than most ... and we were treated like cheap poor kids . I had dinner reservations at Spaiggia and wanted to order a car to pick us up , the concierge exclaimed that , `` You know its not jeans and running shoes right Mr . Blank ? '' Assuming I was too dumb to realize that a 5 star $ 200/person restraunt wont allow tennis shoes because I am young ? Very Dissapointed . Very nice looking , comfortable beds , great room service , contemporary , younger crowd , but service was terrible .

My husband and I stayed here for three nights while visiting Chicago as tourists . What a beautiful hotel ! Our room was lovely , the staff was super helpful and the location was convenient . They do n't have an in house gym , but each day you can get a day pass to a cushy gym down the street . The restaurant in the hotel has a very yummy breakfast . The concierge helped us to make dinner reservations at the last minute our first night there . We were able to walk down the Magnificent Mile from our hotel , as well as through the Gold Coast and Old Towne neighborhoods . There are tons of great restaurants in the area ( including the famous Gibsons and the Signature Room in the Hancock tower ) as well as lots of shopping . There is currently a lot of construction going on near the Talbott ( they are building condos right behind it ) , but regardless we had a wonderful stay and would definitely stay there again when visiting Chicago .

This is my second time here in two months ; both stays were great . The rooms are very nice and very clean . The staff is terrific and always attentive . My only concern would be there never seems to be anyone at the concierge desk .

If I did n't have to stay here , I would n't . Without exception , I swear I am not lying , every day of my stay brings a new problem . Over the past 3 months , I have stayed here 6 times for 3 nights at a time ; problems every time . From the wrong food with room service , to room keys that dont work , unrefreshed bath towels , forgotten and dirty in-room coffee service , unclean ice bucket overnight , forgotten room cleaning , inability to connect to the Internet ... .I 'm too tired to keep writing all the problems . For the price of this chi-chi downtown hotel , I expect more . Finally , their team is certainly not trained in customer service . The front desk teams have attitudes , and Aria 's hostesses think they are something else . I 'm stuck using this hotel since it is adjoined to Aon , but I would never go back if I had a choice . The only good thing is the food at Aria - outstanding .

Just back from spending Memorial Day weekend in Chicago . We decided to stay at the Talbott , and we reserved a room there over a month ago . I must say that we found the staff to be wonderful , but the accommodations to be quite disappointing . We were given room # 1605 . Avoid this room at all costs ! The adjacent elevator is so noisy that it will keep you awake most of the night ( and then awaken you at 6 AM ) . In addition , we had requested a king bed , and # 1605 has two doubles . We were also surprised that there was no coffee maker in the room . Despite the very friendly staff and its super location , the Talbott was less than what we expected , and we would probably not stay there again .

I believe I can not describe how amazing was our stay at The James . Service was impecable , from the door man to the front desk . Location could not be better . Yes , you can hear the ambulances in the street from the 14th floor , but , come on , you are downtown , what do you expect ... .Overall noise was not in a level to bother us . The only minor incident was a cleaner that tried to open our room to clean at 9 pm ... PM not AM ? Go figure ...

My husband and I decided to take a trip to Chicago at the last minute and quickly chose the Conrad , not really knowing it 's location . We were pleasantly surprised to find it was almost right on Michigan Ave. ( It 's connect to Nordstroms right in the heart of downtown . ) Great for shopping . The hotel itself was fabulous . The staff was extremely helpful in giving suggestions for shows and restaurants . I recommend going to Joe 's that 's right across the street from the hotel . Everyone was raving about it . . .but we could n't get a reservation . The room was wonderful and the bed and pillows were very comfortable . It had a very warm and inviting atmosphere . My husband loved the workout room . I highly recommend the Conrad ! !

If you want to stay in a fabulous hotel in the city and you 're willing to pay a little extra , I 'd recommend this place.Also , pay the extra for a corner room - the views of the city are spectacular.A short walk to Michigan Avenue . Excellent service from the valets , concierge , lobby agents , and waitstaff in the restaurants . The food in the restaurants was great and room service was n't too shabby either.Well worth the money !

Striking architecture is only the beginning of what can only be described as one of the best hotel experiences of my professional life . The attention to detail in the room and the bathroom is remarkable and the bed is the best night 's sleep I 've ever experienced in a hotel . Gorgeous LCD tv and Bose wave machine added to my enjoyment . Sofitel is worth the extra $ 's .

We have been for the first time in Chicago and stayed in the Swissotel for five nights , a wonderful place.Room was on the 29th floor , absolutely clean and nice and a breathtaking lakeview.Breakfast perfect and service really good.People were always helpful.It 's a little bit far from Magnificent mile and the loop , but in front of the hotel there are buses ( number6 ) waiting there next turn , not a real bus stop , but drivers are frindly and you can get on the bus.Next time going to Chicago we will again stay in the Swissotel .

For a supposed 4-star hotel , I was not very impressed at akk . The lobby was nice and modern-looking , but there were no bellhops outside to help with bags or open the doors ( we did n't arrive that late at night ) . Additionally , when we walked into the hotel late one night , there was trash and flowers strewn on the lobby floor and , it seemed that there were always water bottles and glasses near the seating area as you walked in . Where was the staff to clean up ? That 's not a very welcoming sight . The rooms were nice and clean and provided a great view , but the actual location was farther than I would have preferred from Michigan Avenue , andi it was also a little too far south . Area recommendations Rush Street was a lot of fun at night !

My sister and I stayed on the 22nd floor , there was a refrigerator in the hallway for the first three nights , beat up and old dorm style . It was not until we told the concierge that we were going to post the picture we took of it on Tripadvisor did the thing get removed . Breakfast dishes left outside rooms will stay on the floor for a day or two routinely . All night there are chimes that make noise , that are supposed to be comformting or relaxing and rather they are just annoying . There is no wifi - no matter what they tell you , I paid for the wifi , and still we were unable to get on . Lastly , my sister and I split the bill , I had already paid for the first night in form of a deposit and they gave her the credit . Room cost with city taxes etc . was 313.69 a night . I know the Comfort Inn just a few blocks away is significantly cheaper ! So while the View was wonderful , it is NOT worth the money .

This was our third trip to Chicago this year ( we LOVE the city ! ) - every time we stay at a different downtown hotel . Swissotel was definitely our favourite . When we come back in July to see the play `` Wicked '' for the second time , we will be again at Swissotel . No more need to try other hotels ! The location is good because it is between the financial district and the Magnificent Mile . The room was spotless and quiet , the view amazing and those elevators were so fast . Comfortable beds , friendly service , not as many noisy sirens ! We even watched the Navy Pier fireworks from our bed ! This was the best anniversary ever . We would recommend Swissotel to everyone !

We stayed here because of all the great reviews , and it 's all true . We were highly impressed with the high quality of everything , everyone , and the location . Walking distance to much of what Chicago has to offer . Gibson 's steakhouse and the Hancock building to name a couple . This hotel should really be in the top ten or even top five hotels for Chicago . It should also have more than three stars . I mean three stars is for the hilton garden inn or marriott courtyard , and this place far exceeds chain hotels like those . Depending on the room you get , any price under $ 250 would be a good deal . Between 250 - 300 could still be worth it .

After reading the reviews & getting an excellent rate through travelzoo , I decided to give this hotel a try . I must say it was a great choice ! The location is perfect , just off from N Michigan Ave , walking distance from everything . The staff was very helpful and friendly , and the room was excellent . They gave us a corner room w/a great view . As many have posted , the bed & pillows were very comfortable ( I am very picky about that ) . I slept well every night ! The renovation is almost done & did not bother us one bit . I highly recommend this hotel .

I stayed here for business and loved it . Got it for $ 93 inc tax on Priceline , an incredible deal for this hotel . If I was n't on priceline I would expect to pay $ 200 per night ( maybe more ) for this location/level of service . It 's in the heart of downtown Chicago , walkable to many locations . The lobby is very impressive , the room was very nice . No complaints at all , from check-in to check-out . I was alone so did n't go to the bar but it looked like people were really enjoying themselves . It was full of people all the time . I want to stay here when I come back with my husband for a fun weekend in the city .

Firtly they took $ 372 off my card , even though they also took the same amount off of one of my friends for staying an extra night . They had no business taking the money off of my card . So on the 28th Sep I contacted them and they admited to the mistake . It is not a month later and I have called them about 6 times in all and they have still not paid it back . Secondly I booked 8 rooms at buy 2 get 3rd room free direct with hotel . When I looked a week later , they had only booked 7 and refused to offer me the rate 3rd room free rate , so two of my friends did n't come to the trip away . Thirdly I asked if the initial money for all rooms could be taken ASAP as the dollar was weak against the pound . After about 8 phone calls over 5 months ( each saying they would ) they eventually took the money and the whole trip cost an additional PS150 . Overall , the hotel was nice and in a nice location , but I will never be staying there again due to all my problems .

Beautifully appointed , professionally staffed , comfortable , well-located , and elegant , with wireless internet access ( plus free access in an alcove on the second floor ) , fitness center ( a little small but fine if you use it at the right time ) , good energy clientele , easy access to Michigan Avenue , next door to 24-hour restaurant , 2 blocks from 2 Starbucks , elevators that are there before you get your finger off the button - they thought of everything . Will definitely return !

My daughter and I were in Chicago for one night after having attended a three-day conference elsewhere in Illinois . We were only in Chicago on our way home . We did n't know where to stay in Chicago , but booked one night at the Sheraton Chicago Hotel and Towers based on their ad in the Chicago Visitors Guide . We 're glad we did ! We enjoyed our stay very much . Our room was very comfortable and well appointed and had a wonderful view of the city . That 's what we wanted -- a great view , and we got it . Also , the hotel is within walking distance of many attractions and is accessible from the bus stop ( we took the train and bus from the airport into the city and it was n't bad -- saved us a lot of money ) . The elevators to our room were fast and quick and there was one always available . We found the front desk staff to be friendly and accommodating . The only downside for us is that we had only booked one night in Chicago . We wish we could have stayed there at the Sheraton for at least another night . We would definitely stay there again .

We live down the block from the hotel . We arranged to have new floors put in our condo while we were away . The floors were not finished when we returned so we looked for an inexpensive local hotel for one night . I think the Ambassador East was the least expensive hotel within a reasonable distance so we decided to stay there . Over the years I had had some visiting groups stay there . I had also eaten there and been to the bar but I had never stayed there myself . The lobby is elegant . The service is great and the room was large and clean although a little outdated . The location is the best residential area in the city ( as far as I am concerned -- I live two blocks away ) and it is very convenient to North Michigan Avenue ( a good shopping street ) and reasonably convenient to the Loop ( the main business area ) There are also probably 50 restaurants in all price ranges in reasonable walking distance including some of the best in the city . I paid less than $ 100 including tax for one night . I am not sure what their regular rates are but I think my deal was the best travel bargain around .

I stayed at the Allegro in July for 4 nights for a business trip . The room was spotlessly clean and the bed was great . I had read reviews that said the bathrooms were tiny , but ours was perfectly fine , with funky , fun doors . The decor is a lot of fun . We were on the 15th floor and there was absolutely no street noise . The front desk staff was very friendly , and before we even made it to the desk , a lovely man took our bags and brought them up to our room within moments of our arrival . We were within walking distance to all the theaters and even walked one night all the way to Navy Pier . For people who were upset about no free coffee - there 's a Dunkin Donuts about a block away . I definitely recommend this hotel !

Great , awesome service . Seriously , the people are amazing . That , and the nice bartender who serves after last call ( at least , that 's what I was told - I of course do n't drink ) save this place from one star . But seriously blah , small , non-luxury rooms with beds that are just really uncomfortable - and for a card rate of $ 725/night , even in a major city , the rooms better be awesome . I 've had waaaay better rooms in NYC for $ 350/night . ( Good thing I had a corporate rate . ) And my room was not especially big , despite what the below reviews say . But here 's the main problem . Even on the 10th floor , the guy blowing the whistle to summon cabs downstairs woke me up at 6 , and 6:15 , and 6:30 , and 6:45 , and 6:50 , and 6:55 , and ... and , well , I finally got up and said screw it , let 's greet the day . Maybe everyone else was already up , but somehow I doubt it . Am now safely ensconced in the Four Seasons .

I stay at this hotel 2 times a year on business and LOVE it ! The staff are great , the rooms are spacious and clean , and the location is perfect for shopping and dining on Michigan Ave. Plus if you sign up for Omni Select Membership ( for free ) you get free wireless internet access .

Beautiful historic hotel -- and since I 'm in historic building business , was looking forward to stay . Moved rooms on second night because of loud party in adjacent suite , they escorted me to a room that was completely torn up -- duct work torn apart in bathroom , lamp fixtures literally falling off wall , mirror torn off wall , etc . Ended up in a room on 20th floor -- much nicer , but yesterday waited 10 minutes for elevator on two separate occasions . Only two of three elevators to top floors work -- and these two elevators skip floors , so you can be stuck waiting for ever . When I raised this to hotel staff , was told this was an old hotel and basically to stuff it . Umm , no . This is not an old building problem , this is a fixable elevator problem if anyone cared enough to fix it . Thumbs way down , stay away . Go to the Drake or Knickerbocker if you 're looking for old world charm , sans hassle .

My husband and I were in the Fairmont Chicago recently for a conference . We stayed in a spacious suite . All amenities appeared recently updated and in excellent shape . The bed was very comfortable . Views were great . I love their products in the bathroom and used them in the pristine tub two out of three nights . The room was so quiet , it was very relaxing . We ate in the restaurant downstairs ( Aria ) and although pricey , it was excellent . The staff were consistently attentive and responsive . It is evident that everyone is very well-trained . I would love to stay here again .

I arrived at the Sofitel for a joint leisure and business . It is a fantastic hotel and made the trip very memorable . The rooms are spacious , great beds , pillows and linen . The bathroom has a great shower and bath . WiFi works really well and the desk is large . The staff are wonderful . The location is great for shopping , spa 's , Starbucks and hairdressers . I loved every minute of it and would not hesitate to stay there again or recommend it .

The room was dingy and run down - it felt like staying in a cheap motel . The carpet was exceptionally worn , wallpaper peeling , bathroom grout dingy . The place felt like it had n't been redecorated in 30 years . On top of that , the windows would not open ( not unusual for a hig-rise hotel ) , and there was no air fan for ac or heat - how the temp control was supposed to work , I have no idea ( they said 'radient cooling ' whatever that is ) , but we had to call down to the front desk and ask for a floor fan to cool the room and have some air circulation . We even went so far as to prop the door open and put the fan in the fan in the door while we were in the room to not feel suffocated . So much for privacy . I ca n't comment on the food , because we ate out at every chance . Chicago has some fantastic food ! And much of it within easy distance to the hotel . The hotel is in a good location , near the waterfront and millenium park , shopping and dining . The conference facilities were average , but frustrating because they were in the basement and cell phone reception was non-existent . I will never stay in this hotel again , especially for the price , because of the poor room quality .

I loved this hotel - reasonable for downtown Chicago , an older hotel with a great reno ( a bit over-the-top design , but still very lovely and charming ) , clean rooms , and very friendly staff . They 're also amazingly pet-friendly - they welcomed our 130lb Mastiff cross with a gift bag ( treats and directions to an off-leash area ) , and even had a cute blackboard with visiting dog 's names on it .

October 3rd , 2007 My wife and I stayed at The Sofitel toward the end of September 2007 . The hotel is VERY modern . The room was immaculate , but the furiture looked as though it came from IKEA . It was chipped in many places . The light switches were difficult to find , and the HVAC made noise . However , the bed was wonderful . The bathroom was large and well maintained . Housekeeping brought us as many towels as we wanted . The restaurant was small . You can eat for less at a 24 hour restaurant around the corner called Tempo . If you want a truly great breakfast try The Peninsula Hotel . However , after dining there you might not want to return to The Sofitel . Prior to checking in we had paid for everything in full . When we checked in , we were asked to leave a credit card for incidentals . Upon returning home , we discovered that although the credit card had not been used the Sofitel had an authorization placed on it . This reduced the line of credit , and it took several days to be removed from the card . Great location ! Reasonable value . If you have a Privilege Card they allow you to check out at 4pm as opposed to 12 in the afternoon .

My husband and I stayed at the Hotel Allegro in March , 2006 . We had a great time ! We were upgraded to a suite , and enjoyed the jacuzzi tub with Mr . Bubbles , animal print robes , and a luxurious king- sized bed ! THe suite was very nice , and we had no problem with noise from other rooms or from the street . It was very boutiquey , and the lobby was lovely . We enjoyed the complementary wine hour . The staff was attentive , and our stay in this Kimpton hotel made our first-time trip to Chicago memorable ! We would return here !

My wife and I stayed here for a long weekend and it was great . The check-in staff changed our room to a single bed without question , and the bar served the best martini I have had in a while . The rooms were well decorated and spacious , although it did get a little tight through the bathroom door . The bell staff was very accomodating and walked my wife up to our room when she arrived late . I would definitely stay here again !

This was a great place to be ! Great views of river and lake , walk to everything , a clean and comfortable room , and very accommodating staff . We arrived early and were checked in by 10:30 am and checked out late , effectively adding two days to our vacation . It is a large hotel but the staff works hard and takes good care of the customers .

Stayed here with friends for a long weekend in August and loved the hotel . Enjoyed the free nightly wine happy hour , and the accomodations were quite nice ( our beds were very soft and comfortable ) . We had excellent views of the river from our rooms . The location was wonderful for seeing the sights around town , with easy access to public transportation nearby . My friends actually received the goldfish upon request , which they enjoyed . Some noise could be heard from rooms nearby or above , but it was minimal . Price seemed very resonable to us for the location . Will certainly return to the Windy City and plan on staying here again .

Move beyond the rock theme and it 's an average hotel with a good location . Room was unbearably hot and the controls on the wall did nothing . Thank goodness the window opened or we 'd have been cooked alive . That of course let in all the noise from Michigan Ave . This combined with our neighbors door slamming against their thrown door lock every 30 seconds made for a lively setting . Room was stuffy too . Burn marks on carpet lead me to believe nasty smokers had occupied room on many occasions . Wife happy w/ Aveda in bath . Base bar was good with great service and well made drinks tho pricey .

In my experience the Ambassador hotel did n't seem to be a 3 1/2 star establishment . The building and lobby were nice but the hotel room was extremely dated . The carpeting was very old and worn . The floor - carpeting and tile both seemed dirty which made me very uncomfortable . I would imagine that many years ago this was a very nice hotel . Currently , it 's indespirate need of renovation .

We stayed at the Conrad for 2 nights for a friends reunion . The room was clean and new feeling , nice city view , free bottled water in room upon arrival . Check in was a breeze , and our room was ready even though we were several hours early . All staff was friendly and helpful , excellent breakfast .

While I had stayed in the Hotel Monaco before , this was my husband 's first trip to Chicago and I insisted we stay here as I loved it the first time . Well the second stay was even better -- we had one of the corner suites on the river -- the service was excellent and staff was very friendly and helpful . The warm cookies in the afternoon is a nice touch after a day of sightseeing . Unfortunately we missed the wine hour . One thing that realy impressed me is that b/c of flight delays we got to Chicago a day late -- Hotel Monaco manager waived the cost of the first night on our room even though it was a guaranteed reservation .

This hotel is rather stupid to be frank . It 's a horrible attempt to be retro-sheek but ends up looking similar to that Saturday Night live skit where things are so sheek that they are not functional . The rooms are about the size of a shoe box and there is n't much in them . I actually like the Pedestal in the bathroom but there is no sink . I had to put my make-up on using the toliet for 5-days . It also took me 10-minutes to figure out how to turn on the shower and the bathroom is more like a closet then anything . I had guests over one evening and everyone could hear everyone pee b/c the bathroom doors are n't doors at all and there is no bathroom fan ! It was just over the top for me and lots of costruction nearby to keep you up at night . On a good note , the staff are really friendly and the place is really clean . That 's about the only good thing I can say about this place . I would not go back .

I expected a glamorous room and I walked into a disappointment . Housekeeping and Management must not be concerned with attention to detail at this hotel . If you like staying somewhere that the air in the rooms does n't go down past 74 , the closet is 24 '' wide , all old/dirty brass fixtures , beds that are a little bigger than a twin , showerheads that barely put out water , then this is your hotel . I might be spoiled by staying in Marriott 's , but I stay in hotels 1/3 of the year and was severly disappionted . No free breakfasts or a room change will get me to stay here again .

After checking out of the Sofitel Chicago Water Tower the other day , I left the hotel , crossed the street and started to walk EB on Chestnut while looking for a cab . I was still within sight of a Sofitel doorman when I sighted a cab approximately one block away and attempted to hail same . After doing so , I immediately heard a Sofitel doorman yelling for me to stop and then heard the sound of his whistle . As the cab slowed to pick me up , the doorman continued to yell at me and blow his whistle as he started to run in my direction . When the cab stopped , I quickly entered cab and locked the door for fear of being physically attacked by the Sofitel doorman . After locking the door , the doorman attempted to open the door as he continued to accost me from outside of the cab . After claiming that he had hotel customers waiting for cabs , he suggested that I had no right to hail a cab in the vicinity of the hotel and then called me a `` jerk '' before allowing the cab driver to depart to my destination . Consequently , unless you enjoy being accosted by hotel doormen , please do n't attempt to hail a cab anywhere near the hotel under any circumstances without first securing the permission of a doorman . Lastly , as for the rest of my stay , you will enjoy this hotel if you seek a highly pretentious staff who prefer to speak to guests in French instead of English . While I have nothing against the French or French language , I much prefer communicating in English when visiting one of the best cities in the best country in the world . Viva la USA !

My sister and I went to Chicago for a weekend and decided to stay at this hotel because I have a friend who works at Homewood Suites here in Cleveland so we got a discount . The valets were really friendly , you get in and out service when you pay for parking with the hotel . Check-in is on the 6th floor because there are restaurants beneath the hotel at street level . That also made finding the hotel tricky because I expected a groove to pull into and it turned out that I just had to pull over to the right side of the street . The lady at the front desk was friendly and informative . Our room was very clean . The fact that it is an extented stay hotel was nice when it came to bringing home leftovers from restaurants , storing and reheating food . The complimentary breakfast was great ! They have real food such as eggs , bacon , french toast , cereal , bagels , juice , milk , and yogurt . The hotel is in walking distance from everything and there is a trolley that goes to Navy Pier and passes by Michigan Avenue . They also have free WiFi . Overall , I would definately stay here again and I would recommend it to others .

my husband and l stayed here after a very hectic week in new york . The room was very spacious and clean , the bed was huge and extremely comfortable . I really liked the Aveda bathroom products , great smell . We had room service the first night and it arrived really quick and piping hot . Compliments to the chef . The concierge was very helpful as we needed to find a few places and we were meeting up with friends and did not know how to get to Navy pier , directions were given to us accompanied by a map . The weekend we were there it was their annual air and navy show , this was spectacular . The whole of the last day of the show we spent at Navy pier and the Millenium park . Location of the hotel is very good for most things especially shopping . If we are ever in Chicago again we will definately stay here .

The only minus for this hotel is they do not provide the free morning coffee at all the other Kimpton hotels . It was a great place to stay for the theater but our rate did say morning coffee . The robes were not in the room and it took a long time ( hours ) but other than that a great place . The concierge was excellent .

Arrived at 1:30am only to find that sleep was not in my future because of the dance club connected to the hotel . If you party and stay out all night anyway , this hotel would be fine . But do n't plan to get any rest if the club is open ! Front desk lady was extremely rude to people calling in to inquire about the hotel while I was checking in . She was fine with me and gave me a corner room , but sure would n't want to be on her bad side .

Check ins went smoothly . But be advised ... . Walls are super thin , the building is old and the rooms are very very very small . The downside of them allowing pets was that we could hear the poor dog barking in the morning probably because it needed to go out . For the price it was n't bad . It was walking distance to most major attractions . Overall ... it 's ok at best . Another plus is the CTA is close by .

We stayed 2 nights over spring break in what was called a Jr Suite but resembled a wide hallway with a window at one end . Bad cheap furniture , carpet that stops short of reaching the wall , a TV that sticks out into the middle of the room and a window that whistled when the wind blew . BAD BAD experience . Find aother hotel plenty in the area .

This is a great hotel but there is no way that I would recommend it until the construction around it is complete . The elevator is the alley starts for the construction site behind at 5:30am and goes on into the night . Dumpster filling and emptying also seems to go on 24/7 . Worst of all , the restaurant is open to the sidewalk cafe here and the rats go scampering from the construction next door to street to grating . Ugh !

I had requested a quiet room several weeks in advance , yet was given a room facing the street from which I could hear traffic noise . I asked to be moved and was told that nothing was available until the next day . The next morning , prior to being moved to a quiet room , the toilet in my original room overflowed creating a large unsanitary flood . About an hour later I was moved to a room which did not face the street . The room was quiet but smaller and darker . The mattresses in each room were very firm , I would even say hard . I asked if any softer mattresses were available and was told that the mattresses were all the same . At checkout I tried to give the hotel a form of payment that differed from the card the room was reserved under , and this process was still not done correctly after 10 minutes , which seemed longer because the van to the airport was waiting right outside , with other passengers . ( The cost was not correctly charged until almost a week later . ) As recompense for the noise , flood , etc. , the hotel offered exactly nothing . Not a great stay .

The Good LOCATION Views Decor Room Service Friendly Staff The Bad Shower curtain in replacement room was too short and leaked Bed was just Ok The Ugly Had to pack our bags again and change rooms after loud noises from the elevator kept us up . I am a heavy sleeper but even with my white noise app cranked on the hotel 's iPod dock it was still loud enough to keep me up . Also our toilet leaked into a puddle by the shower . The staff did however provide a replacement room although not immediately . Also , they mentioned that they had AREADY been aware of the noise problem with that room from past customers .

On our visit to Chicago , we chose the Hyatt due to its location in downtown , within walking distance to most major attractions , such as Sears Tower , Magnificent Mile , Grant/Millenium Parks , etc . Subway & bus stops very close by to travel to other locations in the city . Overall the hotel was very nice , clean , and at a great location . Was in a safe area . Went to beautiful Wrigley Field and Soldier Field and saw both teams play . I love Chicago and would defenitely stay here again !

We stayed at the Omni between Christmas and New Year 's in 2008 just to get away for a few days . We found it through web deals and got a penthouse suite very cheap . So this year we checked online just a day or so after Christmas and the deal was there again . It also included parking at the great price . Huge suite overlooking downtown Chicago . Best location to walk EVERYWHERE . My 12 and 11 yr olds loved swimming at night and the chocolate cookies on their pillows . Ca n't wait to go back .

Apart from the location , great , but it stops there . Upon check-in , I was informed I would have a queen bed . I asked for a king size bed , and I was told there would be a charge for going up to a king . GIVE ME A BREAK , a surcharge for going from a queen to a king . When I got up to the room , it was like a oven . I could not get the air to work and needed to call twice before getting service . Everything in the room had a charge associated to it , even down to the coffee , $ 1.00 . Now what 's up with that ? I was very disappointed in the size of the bathroom . Very small . I have stayed there twice and with so many other options , I feel this will be my last .

I just enjoyed a 3-day weekend at the Swissotel Chicago . A friend of mine booked it and got a GREAT rate . Cheaper than even a fleabag motel . So keep an eye out for specials . The view was great , the location was prime . The staff was helpful . The room was large ( we had 2 double beds ) . I only have one complaint . Our room was next to some sort of storage or mechanical room where employees ( I think ) would sneak off to talk on the phone . The sound came right though the vent in our bathroom and we could hear them plain-as-day . Fortunately , the sound was only in the bathroom so it was n't like it kept us up at night . It was just a little weird . Overall , a great stay and I will definitely stay there again .

I stayed @ Affinia for one night on a purpose not to drive all the way from NW suburbs to Women 's hospital oir my surgery . Few things I really did n't enjoy - I could hear noise from outside all night long as well as inside noise from slamming doors.No noise insulation at all ! Very dusty between window frames ( I understand - cars , pollution ) but it looked like it was n't cleaned for a very long time.One more thing really made me upset - broken blinds on a right side . I was unable to pull them down to enjoy my sleep time ... We did n't notice the problem until very-very late.The Affinia hotel serving tourists and guests of Chicago as well as Northwestern Hospital patients and their families - which really need extra privacy and comfort ! Strange but every hotel I stayed @ was supplied with the SEALED roll of toilet paper.Affinia did n't even offer that.Looked like someone used a bathroom right after it was taking care of by a cleaning lady ! Neither toilet paper nor toilet seat were sealed for us to use ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! ! Hopefully , no more surgeries for me ... Wo n't stay @ this place for leisure - even with discount !

Attended a conference at the Palmer House and it truly surpassed my expectations . I had no idea it would be so large , so nice and with so many amenities . I also did n't realize that it is just around the corner from Milenium Park and the Art Institute . We were met at the door by the friendliest staff . Even with a long line at check-in , the entire process was about 10 minutes . We enjoyed the room with the up-to-date TV , decent size bathroom and comfortable bed . Had a fantastic breakfast buffet as well as a delicious take-out lunch at the main restaurant . Paid $ 200/night through the conference which seemed quite fair considering downtown Chicago . We have stayed at the Sofital which is much more upscale , but we also paid over $ 300/night there .

I have stayed at the Palmer a half dozen times in the past and it has been ok . The main drawbacks are the check in desk is always slow and they charge you to use the fitness center , which is truly annoying . In addition , there are so many rooms you often have to walk a hundred years to find your room once you get off the elevator . Other than that , it is a classic old hotel with some yesteryear charm . But , the room they gave me most recently was so small it was laughable . The door to the bathroom could not open as it hit the desk , and the chair to the desk could not be properly pulled out as it hit the bed . There was no room for them to put the TV in front of the bed , so they shoved it off to the side . Room 23242 makes prison cells seem roomy and I promise that no one who works there would ever put someone they know in this hovel . It should not be sold as a hotel room .

My daughter and I woke in the morning wanting to go swimming . When we arrived at the pool the water was covered by a white scum . I then attempted to use both of the phones at the pool , one white phone and one emergency red phone , to call the desk . Both were out of service ! ! ! ! I am glad there was n't an emergency . As we were exited the pool area I ran into a hotel employee and told her about the problems and then asked her to call us when the pool was clean ... . never heard back .

My husband and I were very excited to be staying at the Conrad , unfortunately , we would never stay in this hotel again . The rooms looked nice , but the closer you look there was mold in the bathroom and red stains that looked like dried blood near the sink . The room service cost was super high - costing us over $ 100 for 1 burger , 1 order of french toast , 2 pops and 2 desserts . In the middle of the night the pipes in our room made a very loud vibrating noise which kept us awake . We called the front desk and it took almost 40 minutes for someone to walk over to our room ( we were on the 5th floor , same as the reception desk ) . They did nothing to fix it and the same thing continued the following night and anytime the room above us or to the right used their shower . The staff was friendly enough , but NOT helpful and they did nothing to try and make our stay better with all of the problems . There was not even a coffee pot in the room . Definitely would NOT stay here again for the price . NOT worth it !

Had a week long stay at the Hilton on south Michigan while attending a meeting . The hotel has some elegance in the lobby , meeting rooms and lounges - the hotel rooms could definitely use updating . I would definitely say that for the price of a room here - the rooms should be top notch . My car was misplaced during valet parking , our reservations were messed up , hotel staff showed up repeatedly throughout the week at our door with items ( room service , a new coffee pot , laundry ) that was n't ours . I would not stay at this property again . There are much better places for the money in close proximity to Michigan Ave . It is a very big hotel and at times it felt like we were staying at Faulty Towers .

If you love Brick Walls and Alleyways , then this view is for you . I asked for a room facing the river , I get a room facing a Brick Wall . That really pissed me off . From all the great reviews , I was expecting better . Before I came here , I stayed in a Hyatt in NYC , and that was awesome . There was nothing about the hotel that blew me away . The wine hour was ok . I was hoping there would be something better food , but I guess that 's why it 's a wine hour . I ordered room service one night . There was n't really anywhere to eat it , so I had to eat it on my bed to watch tv . This was my first time coming to Chicago , and I think it will be my last . Just thoroughly disappointed .

Booked a room w/ a queen bed for 2 nights for a wonderful NYE , and was rather disappointed . Bed was either the world 's smallest queen , or was actually a double , not to mention it was uncomfortably springy . Some of the things in the bathroom had been previously opened and used ( q-tips ) . Lots of noise seemed to carry through the vents as we could hear other rooms rather clearly . When the tv was off , there was a very audible high-pitched humming noise that we could not get rid of unless we unplugged the tv . Hot water was very inconsistent in the shower . It is in a great location , however , next time I will try one of the other hotels in the area like the Intercontinental or Marriott . This might not be too bad if you are passing though quickly on business , but I would n't recommend it for a romantic night or two .

Stayed there three nights from 4/17/09 through 4/20/09 . Chechecked in about 9:15 AM . Had to wait about 15 minutes because of specials requests I had made . Room was quiet , and comfortable . Marked improvement over last time I stayed there ( about 5 years ago ) . The renovations were great , and maintained the old time charm of the hotel .

Be prepared the hotel is old . It is on the historic list . The is updating to be done no doubt.. So just be forewarned . It is clean and the staff is phenomenal . Having said that , you can not beat the location . Right in the heart of the Gold coast . Take a train from O'hare right into the city . It drops you off only 4 blocks from the hotel . One block from the beach and public transportation is right there . Incredible area to explore . I highly recommend the Ambassador East

My stay at the Amalfi was a very brief one . I booked the hotel based on all of the glowing reviews I saw here on Trip Advisor . When I arrived , I sat down at a desk with an amazingly aloof clerk . I felt like I stepped into an episode of the Twilight Zone . The room was very small and dark . Then the Internet was n't working . I was n't informed about this on my check in and could n't be given a time frame when it would be back up . I walked the neighborhood and found another hotel more to my liking , gathered up my belongings and went there . If you 're one of those people who likes trendy upscale and chi chi locations and hotels , you 'll lurve this place . But if you like a hotel with lights on , working internet and a good view and real breakfast , go someplace else .

this is my new favorite place to stay in downtown chicago , and I 've been to this hotel at least 4 times . the rooms are clean , wonderfully designed and comfortable . The staff is friendly , service focused - and the restuarant is great , especially for the breakfast fruit crepes . Love this hotel . It 's a great location , very good and consistent service and quality .

My parents booked five nights at The James for its location and good reviews . They had a terrible first night with defective air conditioning and not much sympathy from the management staff . They sent engineers three times to repair the unit , and they insisted that it was getting cooler when it was n't , under the rationale that the summer temperature is high and the filter was dirty . At my parents ' request , the hotel staff moved them to a lower floor with a queen instead of a king and with neither a rate discount nor an effort to compensate them for the inconvenience and discomfort . The hotel insisted they were fully booked and reluctantly gave them that room . Do n't book this hotel in the summer . And by the way , there is no view at all from any of the rooms - except for the windows of other buildings .

One more thing , in our room the furniture was mostly child friendly except for a large metal and glass outdated coffee table . Within 30 minutes my 5 year old fell and hit her mouth and began bleeding . They need to update this piece of furniture .

Was one of the worst travel experiences of quite some time ... . 1 . Arrived to construction or renovation to main lobby ... no warning . not on the website ... `` thanks for letting me make the choice to stay in hotel with construction site '' 2 . Lengthy line to wait at makeshift reception area ( 25 min wait ) .. check in..ACHE conference -- be prepared for the influx of people for the convention . 3 . Double book room ... . go back to check in ... told to get back in line ... and we will review when it is your turn ... told them I just waited 25 mins.. Curt service worker said wait your turn . 4 . Second room ... dirty dishes from room service in front of door at our check in at 3PM . 5 . Internet kept dropping and slower than dial up network ... . 6 . Second day and Third day stay ... No hot Water to start the day off with cold shower ... . 7 . Check out ... overcharge on bogus fees ... . Travel to Chicago stay at the Palmer House or Fairmont .

We got this hotel by chance since we decided the spur of the moment to spend a nite in Chicago on 7/24/09 . We went thru Priceline and was lucky to get a room at this hotel for only $ 69 ( normal rate was around $ 200 ) . The room was superb on the 29th floor with a nice king bed . Hotel is only about 1.5 blocks to Michigan Ave so the location is very convenient . Parking is very expensive at $ 50 a nite but we parked right next door at a selfpark for just $ 30 . We decided to have breakfast at the hotel restaurant to save us from walking elsewhere . We ordered the buckwheat pan cakes and egg benedict . They were absolutely delicious which stunned us since we did n't expect this type of experience from a hotel restaurant especially for breakfast . Glad we did n't pick their breakfast buffet since the special menu is much better . I highly recommend this beautiful and cozy hotel for your Chicago visit .

I was apprehensive after reading some of the more negative reviews of the Hotel Allegro . However , our stay there was without problems and the staff could not have been more friendly and helpful . The room was not huge but there was plenty of room to move around without bumping into one another . The bathroom was small but well appointed . Overall , it was a clean and interestingly decorated room and we were pleased . Others have complained about being able to clearly hear people in adjacent rooms but we must have lucked out in that way and did not experience that although we could occasionaly hear people talking in the hallway . One other reviewer complained rather bitterly about the area and said that it was dangerous and I ca n't even begin to understand that as we found it to be extremely safe . The area is also very close to public transportation ( we used the trains exclusively ) and got around quite well without a car . We would most definetly stay here again and recommend it to others .

Our third stay at the Homewood Suites Chicago proved to be just as great as the previous two . The staff are consistently friendly , polite and professional - and this applies whether they are working at the front door , servicing the rooms , managing the breakfast room or on the reception desk . They genuinely seem happy to be working here and ca n't do enough for their guests . The rooms are large and clean and seem to have good insulation from each other ( we did n't hear a thing from our neighbours and the hotel was quite busy ) . The hotel is well placed for walking to the shops on Michigan Ave , or catching a bus or subway . There is a Jewel Osco and a Trader Joes each within a couple of blocks , which are perfect for stocking up on groceries etc . My husband heartily recommends 'Binnies Beverage Depot ' for a huge variety of beer . Now all we need is an excuse to return to Chicago next year - then we can make it four years on the run at the Homewood Suites , because we would n't stay anywhere else !

Perfect location , clean and courteous staff all added up to a great stay . Its in an area with plenty of stores ( The Mile ) and restaurants . Hotel lobby is on the 6th floor and the elevator to get there was annoyingly slow but overall I would highly recommend this place regardless if your there with a family , friends or on business . The subway to Wrigley is a 1/2 block away from the front door .

I travelled to Illinois from the UK on business , and booked Friday and Saturday night at the Homewood Suites so that I could have a weekend in the city . The location was perfect , walking distance to Michigan Ave for all the shopping and touristy stuff , and literally 100 yards to the L ( red line ) for getting out to the surrounding areas . The room was great : not exactly 'wow ' decor but clean and really well stocked . I was expecting a 'suite ' to be a larger than average hotel room with seperate sitting area . It was actually a 3-room mini-apartment , with an open lounge/kitchen , bedroom , and bathroom . Two flatscreen TVs and a huge bed . Breakfast buffet eggs and bacon were great for the hangover ( ! ) , and the kitchen meant that I could cook up some lunch rather than eat out if needed .

Seriously overpriced The room was clean and comfortable but did not stand out from any other mid priced hotel . The `` amenities '' were a smoke screen , nothing was offered that you would not get at a much lesser quality motel but they did not have the basics that you would expect from a Holiday Inn . I would gladly have forgone the scale in the bathroom for a cup of hot coffee that I did not have to get dressed and go down to the lobby to purchase . Being charged $ 15/day for Internet on top of a $ 250/night rate was a bit over the top . The bathroom was not well lit which was inconvenient . The shower was a nice size with a fantastic over-sized shower head , unfortunately twice the water pressure was low so the effect was lost . The staff were friendly and helpful , actually the best part of the stay were the staff . All in all I found it overpriced for the quality of the room .

Let me start by saying we are seasoned travelers who take 5-6 trips for pleasure on a yearly basis ( not including our business travel ) . We 've traveled all over the world and often stay at older hotels because of their charm and attention to detail . We were not at all impressed by this hotel . At $ 220/night we were expecting a decent , clean hotel but obviously not a 5* . We were highly disappointed by the state of the room we were given ( 1546 ) . The paint/wallpaper/tub were peeling , there was hair in both the tub/toilet when we got to the room , the internet service was extremely slow , the toilet ran throughout the night , and quite frankly we were not convinced the bedding was changed from the previous guests as it was wrinkled and look slept in . We told the gentleman working at the front desk about the state of our room and his response was `` I know , we ca n't wait for our renovations . '' If it had n't been for the fact we were meeting up with our relatives who were traveling from the UK & booked into this hotel by a travel agent , we would have checked out as soon as we checked in . Let me also add that the front desk seemed short-staffed as the check-in/check-out process was painfully slow . All we can credit the hotel with is a great location and very friendly/responsive door staff . In its day this was likely a lovely hotel & but it is in dire need of a renovation . Despite its location I can not understand how travelers continue to pay those rates for such a sub-par experience . We would never book at this hotel again .

Overall I had a VERY Bad experience when hosting a meeting for company , but when my parents came in from out of town and wanted to stay at the Swissotel , I thought we should give them another try . Turns out my first impression was correct , this is the LEAST friendly hotel I 've ever been in ! Even the concierge was rude and disagreeable . I could go on and on , but instead I 'll just say GO SOMEWHERE ELSE !

Reservation was for a King size bed , instead I was given a double-bed room . Check-in person must had a bad hair day , because she was unfriendly . Wall St Journal or USA Today is not complimentary . Requested a room that is away from the noisy elevator , but given a room next to a service elevator which is more noisy . I did n't bother to file a formal complain because I was very tire . I travel often to Chicago for business and the first will be the last at Intercontinental .

We stayed in the IC chicago for 6 nights from 26th Dec after reading the reviews on Trip Advisor . We werent disappointed . We had 2 rooms opposite each other in the Historic tower . The rooms were spacious and very clean with good views towards the river and tribune building . We got a good rate on the rooms but did not have breakfast in the hotel as it was very expensive as was the Wifi at $ 17 per day . As the hotel is on the Magnificent mile there are plenty of place to eat including for breakfast . The starbucks in the lobby was a hit with the kids - very handy . I would definitely recommend the hotel .

After reading so many great reviews I booked the Hotel Monaco and was not disappointed . I booked through their web site about 2 1/2 months prior to arrival for $ 170/night plus tax for a room with 2 queens . The location was perfect - right by the river near Michigan Ave. - minutes walk to the El , Millenium Park , the Theater District and Shopping . The room was clean , a little larger than standard and nicely decorated . We had window seats in the room with a view of the river . There was Starbucks coffee in the lobby in the morning and a wine reception in the evening . To top it off , the staff was very friendly and knowledgable about the area .

I stayed in a Deluxe King Suite . No desk to work at or to sit at to eat room service meals . The only table was coffee table height and the couch was some strange futon that was lower than the coffee table ( ! ) and canted forward . Incredibly uncomfortable to sit at and ridiculous for room service meals or to work at computer . Since my room was configured like all the other Deluxe King Suites depicted in on line photos , I have to assume this design flaw with the couch/futon runs throughout the property . Bed was fine and bath was fine but I ca n't imagine why business travelers would rate this property well . The couch/futon seating is the worst I 've encountered in a modern hotel .

Excellent location , about a block from Michigan Ave. and two blocks from Water Tower Place and John Hancock Tower . Beautiful hotel , felt very luxurious and high-class for being a moderate priced hotel . Staff was excellent -- friendly and accommodating .

Ideal location right in the heart of the Near North side but good grief , they need more than two elevators . You can wait 10 minutes for an elevator and if you happen to be on the first floor ( registration desk on 6th floor ) , you can face a long line just to catch one . Rooms are from the same cookie cutter as all Homewood Suites - very utilitarian ; unlike many locations however , this one does not include a DVD player in the rooms . The pool is OK but there 's no jacuzzi . Oh , and housekeeping is deficient when it comes to keeping the towels stocked in the pool area . Front desk service is pretty good .

All I can say is avoid this place at all costs . From the reservations assistant ( who took 45 minutes to book a room ) to check out ( they billed my card for 750 dollars ) and getting a refund ( numerous voicemails and emails no one returned my call ) . AVOID AVOID AVOID a truely hideous experieince I will never stay at a Starwood resort again , and given I stay in a hotel 4 or 5 days a week this is a big statement !

I stayed in this hotel for 5 days in November together with my colleagues . Internet only wired available for 20 additional dollars a day . No fridge or microwave included in the price . Our room had two too soft full size beds . In the hall way the wallpaper had come off the wall . Who doesnt believe it , check out the 16th floor close to room 212 . With discount we paid more than 300 dollars a night which is ridiculous . I stayed in the Hyatt Regency before for much cheaper and that was way better . The restaurant in the main hall is very nice and the food is tasty , but although being almost the only customer it took forever that the food got served . please stay away and take one of the plenty alternatives nearby .

My wife and I just returned from a 3 night stay at the Amalfi Hotel in Chicago and enjoyed everything about the Hotel . Most importantly our room was perfect with plenty of space , great jazz CD 's in the room , wonderful bathroom and one of the most comfortable beds I 've ever slept in . The staff was very helpful with every request . The Amalfi offers a great continential breakfast on every floor each morning with good coffee and a great selection of pastry 's , fruit 's and jucie 's . We also enjoyed the managers receptions one evening where they offer a great choice of complementary cocktails and antipasta 's for their guests . Would highly recommend this hotel .

I have stayed at many hotels traveling for both business and pleasure and I can honestly stay that The James is tops . The service at the hotel is first class . The rooms are modern and very comfortable . The location is perfect within walking distance to all of the great sights and restaurants . Highly recommend to both business travellers and couples .

Check-in was fast , the room was perfect , and there were no problems . This is a standard big-city business hotel with every amenity imaginable . I got a very good deal for a one-night stay , but they made the money back from the exorbitant parking rate and the absurd access fee for wireless internet . If you are bored of the routine hotel fare , walk two blocks to Gourmet Pantry ( 155 N. Michigan ) for a refreshing change .

I travel often for business and this hotel ranks very low on my list . The room had such a strong odor of smoke , it gave me a headache ( and I used to be a smoker ) ! The room service was mediocre and extremely expensive . The hotel is disturbingly huge . Very difficult to navigate your way around it . I waited on hold for twenty minutes to ask a concierge where a pharmacy was located . She curtly gave me cross-street names and hung up . Uhhhhh , how do I know which direction to go in ? ? ? Stains on the carpet in the room . A big gauge in the wall , where maybe a thermostat once was ? ? ? The shower is decent . All in all , for the price they charge , NO THANKS ! ! ! I 'm just glad my company is footing the bill .

My husband and I stayed here for New Years eve weekend . This is an excellent hotel in an excellent location . Hotel is very tastefully decorated and warmly welcoming . The rooms had the best electronics I 've ever seen . Loved that they had a soaking tub and a spacious shower stall . The hotel restaurant seemed to be empty everytime we walked by , so we avoided it too . Ate at Joe 's across the street - excellent seafood . And you can shop til you drop without going outside ! Nordstroms and four story mall is attached . Lots of good `` food on the run '' places in there . Loved Chicago - loved the Conrad . I will go back !

My friend and I stayed for just one night , and loved the hotel . It had an awesome water feature in the hotel , and great large bar . Like all Hyatts it had a very comfortable bed , lot 's of pillows , and large bathroom .

OK , we are back from the Knickerbocker and I would give it the best rating . I ca n't believe the bad reviews . I got a priceline deal , and I still got a fine room , clean , up-to-date furnishings ( OK a little traditional for my taste ) and smoke free . Someone said in another thread that some people write prank reviews . I think such people should get a life because people want to read the truth . Here it is from my point of view . Both rooms on 10th floor . Regarding the size of the rooms . We had two rooms . One was a 2 double bed room . It was about 20 ' x 15 ' . Each double bed had valences that were kind of mini-canopies . The furniture , bathroom tile , shower ( no tub ) , wall paper and paint had been done in the last few years . A Chinese inspired cabinet held TV , coffeemaker , ice bucket , and mini-bar . Three separate levels ( TV , ice/coffee , and minibar ) The other room was called `` Queen executive '' . This one had queen bed with more of a canopy than valence , sofabed , two TVs and terry bathrobes . Also about the same size but different configerations . One TV faced the bed , other in the three level cabinet , the sofabed . Smoke in the lobby . There is a bar to the right of the entrance . It is an open arrangement so that I am sure the smoke comes from bar to entrance door . No smoke smell in no-smoking rooms . Cost of rooms $ 75 on priceline plus taxes . Very good value one block from N. Michigan Ave. Only complaint . Concierge said that the free trolley did n't go down Michigan Ave to Field Museum/Museum complex when in fact it does . Was this ignorance ? or trying to throw more business to taxi ? Either case , not good . He said at this time of year free trolley only goes to Navy Pier during winter ... .which is clearly incorrect .

As I sit here in my 14th floor room at the hotel Allegro , I listen to the conversation between husband and wife in the room on my left . She seems to have a cough today . In the room on my right , someone seems to use the restroom quite a bit . I hear the water running and the toilet flushing . I also hear footsteps in the room upstairs . Even roadside motels have better insulation between the rooms . I 've stayed in about a dozen Kimpton hotels and this is by far the worst . The room is dirty - the carpet covered in spots and stains , the curtains with a large brown stain ( I do n't want to guess what it is ) , paint peeling , rips in the wallpaper . The decor is a bit garish , with Pepto-Bismol covered walls , green and yellow pillows and the filthy brown and white carpet . The size of the room is fine and the bed comfortable , but I 'm so glad I had earplugs to avoid listening to others ' toilets flushing all night . The location is good for downtown theaters or business . Only three elevators serve this 17+ storey building and they run very slowly . Chicago has many nice hotel options -- many I 've enjoyed quite a bit . Unfortunately this is not one of them , and even more unfortunate for me : I 'm stuck here for two more nights . I was looking forward to staying here because most Kimptons are hip , comfortable and attractive . This is not .

After reading the Trip Advisor reviews , I was expecting an exceptional stay . I was not impressed overall . The concierge , the view , and the hotel resturant were the highlights . The bed , although not horrible , was not nearly as comfortable as mine at home , and I do not consider myself and extremely fussy person . I was traveling for business , and although not dressed in formalwear , was also not dressed down , but all in all , it felt a bit pretentious to me . There are better options for the money , and would gladly stay at the Sutton Place , Sheraton Towers , or Trump for the similar price and better stay . I would ask Trip Advisor to move it down in the ratings ... ... not # 1 in Chicago , in my book .

Overview : -- Overrated hotel in a premium location . The Great : -- Location - walking distance or cheap cab ride to a ton of great restaurants , bars , and sights . The Good : -- Inviting lobby , pleasant staff though a few were a bit snobby , in particular the night deskman . -- Nice bathroom , comfortable bed and desk chair . The Mediocre : -- Room ( excluding bathroom ) was underwhelming in design . -- No kitchen or bar though they have limited room service from Harry Caray 's across the street . -- Free cocktails 5-7pm in `` lounge '' is right idea with wrong execution ; tiny little room packed with people and a line extending out the door . -- Hot water ( or lack thereof ) - almost every morning my shower water temperature would waver between comfortably hot to lukewarm . Pressure is pretty low . -- View - mine was n't great but apparently some of the rooms are horrible . The Bad : -- Free wi-fi / ethernet has inconstant speeds and required multiple logins every day , even when my computer was n't moved - really aggravating . Same deal for my iPhone . I also got numerous vulnerability threat warnings from my Norton Anti-virus that makes me wonder how secure it is . -- No blackout curtains ! I had a corner room with a huge wrap-around window and awoke to bright sunlight every morning ( not to mention a near total lack of privacy at night ) . Never had this issue in any hotel or motel I 've ever stayed at . -- Noise ! - the hotel is sandwiched between a few different bars and the late night cacophony of yelling , bar music , trucks , car horns , and sirens is hugely distracting well into the early hours of the morning . I had to wear ear plugs despite being on the 5th floor . -- TV had crappy HD signal with out of sync audio on every channel . And the remote was useless . -- In room bar had standard inflated prices but the $ 7 bottle of Fiji water bedside was insulting . Do n't even think of opening it ; there 's a 7-Eleven around the corner that sells exact same bottle for a fraction of the cost . Summary : -- Not recommended . Looks much nicer in the website photos than it is . Rating on Yelp is bloated by at a least a star .

This morning , I checked out and left behind one of the worst hotel experiences I 've ever had : Hard Rock Hotel , Chicago . I am in disbelief that this hotel is part of the `` Preferred Hotels '' group . Upon checking in , I was `` greeted '' by a front desk staff that had better things to be doing and let it show . My room was poorly lit and dirty . The desk/desk chair was covered in sticky , dried soda pop ( or something else ? ) which I had to clean myself so I could work . The `` sound system '' was put to shame by my 10-year-old daughter 's boombox . No one , rock star or otherwise , wants to reach more than an arm 's length for toilet paper . Everything is possible . This includes hiring professional and courteous staff to answer customer calls that are directed to the `` everything is possible '' line . Great marketing fails with no follow through . The in-room mini-bar policy ranks in my personal top-five most ridiculous business practices of all time . Do you charge Steven Tyler $ 7.81 for opening his in-room 'fridge ? Looking back , I would have much preferred enjoying cocktails in my dirty room rather than the dirty , drafty , overpriced bar ( with a horrendous wine list ) With the exception of the fact that I was leaving , check-out was no better than checking in . I was n't even asked about my stay ! The young woman who provided me with a copy of my bill could not have been more unpleasant . I , for one , will not bring my business back to that location . Next time I 'm in Chicago , I 'm staying at the Hyatt . Rock on , TripStarr

First , several day s prior to my stay , I called and spoke at length with the concierge and made a breakfast order for room-service Saturday and Sunday . Saturday they did n't bring breakfast - and when I called room-service they stated they never got the advance order from the concierge . When they finally did bring it - they brought the wrong thing.. and then brought the wrong order again on Sunday . I was further inconvenienced by in-room dining staff when we ordered room service Saturday night . The food was limp and uninspired . Further , I ordered soup - which arrived without a spoon . When I called in-room dining to request a spoon , I was told one would be forthcoming . 15 minutes later , a waiter arrived with a menu . When I explained I already had food and I did n't need a menu - I needed a spoon , he had the audacity to argue with me . I respectfully requested he return with a spoon and he agreed to do so . Another 15 minutes ( and one bowl of cold soup ) later I decided to call in-room dining back to request ( again ) they send someone with a spoon . They too argued with me and expressed that they 'd already sent someone with a spoon . I explained that they had not - that I had received a menu I did n't request , but that no spoon was forthcoming . Another 15 minutes later , a spoon finally arrived . Thanks - for charging me $ 100+ so that I could argue over cold , flavorless food . In addition to the gross customer service , surly attitude , and sorry food , I found the room woefully lacking . It reeked exhaust fumes so much so that on Saturday night I woke up from the smell . Further , I had specifically requested when I booked the reservation that you keep me away from the elevators ... I was right next to the elevators and had the displeasure of listening to them ding all night long as other guests came and went .

This review has two parts . . .I advise reading both . Chapter One : The actual hotel and staff I found the in house staff to be very friendly and accommodating . The room was nice and clean as well . I have no disagreement with any of the other reviews regarding the hotel room or the staff . This is a great location where you can walk three blocks to to the South to reach the riverfront , or a few blocks to reach the water tower to the North . Very easy ( one block ) walk from the subway ( Red line ) . The morning complimentary breakfast is substantial . Not just muffins and coffee . You can have a complete breakfast here if you want . And , even the breakfast servers were really nice and efficient . I would recommend this hotel IF based solely on the physical location , the room , and the staff . Chapter Two : The nightmare I booked this room through central reservations in July for a mid-September arrival . The rate was quoted to me as $ 159 per night for four nights . When the confirmation was emailed to me , it was incorrect by over $ 300 . I immediately called the hotel . They said they made the correction and emailed a new confirmation with the correct amount . I did receive the corrected confirmation email . . .All done ? NO . One week later , my credit card statement arrives with the old higher amount having been charged . I called the hotel and was transferred to central reservations to resolve . When I explained the error , I was literally called a liar by the person in reservations , and told `` That 's not my problem . I ca n't help you '' . . . and then told that I have to pay the higher amount . Excuse ME ? Now , I go back to calling the hotel manager to get some assistance . After a few left messages , I get the general manager to call me back , and discuss the issue . After taking down all of the names of people I spoke with , he assures me that he will credit the account immediately . I even get a call from someone in his accounting dept to confirm my credit card etc . . . One week later , still no credit . So , I call the general manager again . Oh , this might take up to 72 hours to process , I am told . So , please give it another week . Another week passes , still no credit . So another call to the manager . I am told now that the credit HAS been processed , and he even sends me an email confirming our `` agreement '' for the credit , just to appease me . Another week passes . Still , not seeing that credit that was `` definitely processed '' a week ago . Yet another call to the general manager on the day before I am to leave on my trip to Chicago . I told him I will be arriving , and at this point , I want to see him personally , and he can physically use my credit card to process the credit while I am there . Remember , we are now talking SIX WEEKS and this is still not resolved . I arrive at the hotel , and to make a long story short , the general manager was NEVER available to see me , nor did he make any attempts to schedule any time to see or talk with me . The only person I spoke face to face with , was the assistant general manager . He was completely unconcerned with my situation , and made the completely inappropriate statement to me of `` you realize this boils down to a matter of 'he said she said ' '' . . . WHAT ? ? ? ? Today , my trip is over , and I have flown back home . I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE CREDIT TO MY ACCOUNT ! ! ! I will absolutely be reporting all of this to Hilton Corporate Customer Service , and will absolutely be disputing the entire amount at this point . Take this little adventure into consideration when dealing with this hotel .

I stayed at the intercontinental during the last weekend in September for a `` pleasure trip '' -- the InterContinental was in a great location and the staff was excellent . The room was clean and comfortable -- and came equipped with a new LG flat panel tv . Had breakfast at Zest ( hotel restaurant ) -- a bit pricey but decent if you want a buffet . The hotel is in walking distance to millenium park , museums and the aquarium . There is also a lot of shopping - window shopping is best though , considering the sales tax is 9.5 % ! ( and possibly raising to 11 % ) Great stay . I highly recommend it and would stay there again .

We have just returned from a week at the James Chicago . The hotel is fabulous , very chic and chilled . The service is beyond compare . Check in and out were swift and painless . The Concierge service is also super efficient having located an excellent hair salon and a couple of fab restaurants for us during our stay . The hotel restaurant itself is rated 5 in the top 10 in Chicago - voted by Chicago residents . We stayed on the 14th floor with great views of the city . The room ( a deluxe king ) was equipped with a great selection of cocktail making lovelies , hairdryer , safe , tv , robes & slippers , a very interesting selection of minibar items ( one of which was a real surprise ! ) including crisps/snacks a first aid kit and an umbrella ! We also had a spotless and elegant bathroom with Kiehls products and a cosy little dining area . The ipod dock/CD/radio and complimentary chillout CD were a nice touch and husband liked the enormous plasma tv . The super comfy bed ensured a good snooze and complimentary WiFi allowed us to plan our next day 's activities from our bedroom . We were so busy touring around the city we did n't get an opportunity to use the gym or the spa - both of which looked fab . The bar/lobby area is a haven of civilised tranquility with smooth music playing in the background to help you chillout that bit more . Staff are attentive without being fussy and a good selection of drinks and bar snacks are available . The barman mixes a mean mohito ! This hotel is full of nice little thoughtful touches to make people feel welcomed and cared for e.g . The Virtual Tuck In service - basically a couple of PCs with webcams to allow people to say goodnight to their children when they 're away from home on business . Also the dog biscuits and water outside the front door for our furry friends . Next visit to Chicago I 'll definitely be staying here and would n't even consider an alternative if The James can maintain these standards .

What 's not to like ? -- > Problems getting the room you actually reserved : I had to call this hotel three times and email four times in order to insure that we actually got the room we had reserved . -- > Overcharging . They charge for everything here . Wireless . The Fitness Center . The Business Center . I 've only run into one other hotel that ever charged for use of the fitness center . Note to the Intercontinental : If you 're going to charge for something that is commonly included , you should advertise that fact . What 's next ? Charging for sheets on the bed ? -- > Very poor customer service . The staff does not communicate in full sentences , or wait to hear your answer . This is Chicago , not New York . How about a little Midwestern patience ?

The Good - excellent location , neighborhood is pretty and quiet , close to shops , restaurants , the waterfront , close to train/subway station , etc The Bad - Very old decor , which is n't a big deal , but the tv was smaller than my PC monitor . We were supposed to have a king bed ( anniversary trip ) we were given two double beds and told we would be switched - that never happened . The shower/tub was stopped up so bad that after I showered my husband waited over one hour for the tub to drain before he could shower . Who wants to shower in someone else 's dirty water even if it is your wife . The indifferent - room was a decent size , bed linens were okay , staff was mediocre to marginally rude

Got a great deal through Hotwire for $ 70 a night but if I ever return to Chicago I would definitely stay again , even at full price . We really liked the rooms muted modern decor , we had John Lennon and Bono for company . Comfortable bed , mini coffe maker , plenty storage space and a lovely , clean bathroom stocked full of Aveda products ( so I was sold straight away ... it does n't take much , I know ! ) . If you 're a product junkie , tip the maid and request some extra bottles and you will leave with lots of goodies : ) We liked the location and had a great view down N Michigan Ave , found the staff to be really friendly and relaxed ( reception , gift shop and bar ) . The bar area is very trendy , I liked the chilled atmosphere which surprised me cause I normally find these types of bars a bit too pretentious for my liking ... the lack of memorabilia did n't bother me but I was more interested in the art deco features of the building itself anyway . The only fault was that the speakers in the room were crackling a bit oh , and my boyfriend thinks he was propositioned by a `` friendly lady looking for business '' when he was at the bar . I think it 's a place you will either love or hate , if you like laid back , contemporary hotels without the intimidating factor then this is the place for you !

My wife & I celebrated our anniversary at the Knickerbocker & could not have been treated better . Before we were out of our cab , our bags had been loaded on a cart & we were walked into the hotel by a doorman . The rooms were well appointed & the entire hotel staff was very friendly . This is a prime location for shopping , sightseeing or nightlife .

I wrote an email to the sales & reservation team a week ago ... ... ... i 'm still waiting for a response . All I wanted to do was book a suite for 2 nights but they failed to even reply with an offer . We have now booked another hotel who can be bothered to answer emails . Shame you missed out , coz we tip like rockerfellers ! !

I recently returned from a trip to Chicago with my husband and baby and another couple and their baby . While the room at the hotel was quite nice we had a very negative experience with the front desk staff including managers . When we arrived it took over an hour to check in . We had requested two rooms on the same floor , which the hotel staff had confirmed a number of times prior to our arrival . When we arrived they could not accommodate us and offered nothing to us to make up for it . Eventually after we persisted they gave us half off for our room for one of the three nights we were there . We also asked the concierge to make us a reservation for brunch at a restaurant that would accommodate 4 adults and two babies in strollers . When we got to the restaurant they had only a reservation for 4 adults and had to make special arrangements to fit the babies in . We also had asked the hotel to make us an appointment for a personal shopper at Bloomingdales in order for us to save time shopping . We filled out forms in advance to direct the shopper and when we arrived for our appointment Bloomingdales advised us that they had only received the applications moments before and had not pulled together our requests . After complaining again to the manager at the hotel of these disappointments she advised that she would send something up to our room to compensate . This `` something '' never arrived . We will not be making a return visit to this hotel . While the housekeeping staff , location and room were quite nice the over all experience was very negative .

The Talbott Hotel itself is a bit worn around the edges . No - not a bit worn - very much so I 'm sorry to say . Although the location a block and a half from the best part of Michigan Ave. ca n't be beat , and the level of service is on par with many Four Seasons , there were quite a few bumps in the road . Number one , the rooms are quite dreary - brown on brown is just so not pleasing . The desk chair was so badly worn that the `` lift '' button simply swirled down when you sat in it and no we 're not grossly obese . The back of the chair leaned so much it was uncomfortable . My husband had to use 2 couch pillows to use it - one to get him up to desk heighth , one up against his back to scoot him up to the desk . The bathroom was oddly arranged so that the door swung up right next to the sink , so if you were using the far sink and someone needed to enter the bathroom you got hit with the door . The towels were very well worn and thin , although bath sized , which was a plus . The restaurant downstairs is practically another posting - suffice to say , it was horrific . We had some appetizers outside on the nice streetside tables , and they ( appetizers ) were awful and looked as though a child had tossed them together in the kitchen . A room service sandwich ordered later in our visit was totally wet on the side , served on a large white plate , and was one slice of meat and one slice of plastic American cheese on a grocery store-like roll - very very sad . Even the menu , as limited as it was , looked as though someone 's child had written it out . The good news is that Chicago is a fairly well-read restaurant town so there are plenty of other places to go . Unfortunately for us , the 3 days we stayed there was a large convention and jazz festival in town so we paid $ 325/nt for our disappointments . The good news is that the mini bars ' wares were incredibly well-priced - when 's the last time you had a $ 4 beer anywhere in a hotel ? ( even if it was Bud and Bud lite - lol ! ~ ) The front desk and curbside staff could not have been more accommodating . The water out of the shower was hot and plentiful , and the bed comfortable . The A/C was not noisy nor uncomfortable whatsoever , and we had it going the entire time as it was in the 90 's our entire stay . Free wi-fi - YES ! And it was n't horribly grindingly slow ! No need for the advertised `` upgrade '' for faster wi-fi . Talbott - please update your rooms and get a new restaurant concept and you will be ahead of the game . Apparently there are enough folks getting deals on rooms here so they are pleased , but we were sadly not .

I asked for a high floor away from the elevator and that is what I got . The room was pleasantly decorated , functional and very clean . I did n't need a whole lot of service but when I did they were pleasant and prompt . I used the fitness center which was well equipped and everything was in working order . It is in a great location at one end of the Michigan Avenue shopping district .

Great front desk staff , the rest of the experience was dreadful . The room service staff have to be among the most poorly trained I have ever encountered . We had to ask FOUR times for the staff not to slam the supply closet , adjacent to our room ( almost in the room itself ) . They do these random room checks for the minibar , as if the entire budget hinged on the sale of a can of $ 9 peanuts . The roomservice is also equipped with walkie-talkies as loud as megaphones . If you like sleeping in on your vacation , do n't stay here . Also , the hotel was under massive construction , a detail that was conveniently excluded from the website . SO we had to take the elevator with construction workers just about every time we used it . No discount because of the work and noise . I 'd rather sleep in a box in the alley .

The hotel was undergoing renovations so it was dirty and noisy . The entrance was really scary since it was covered with scaffolding , making it dark . They charge a lot for internet hook up , wifi is not included . The staff was very slow , I am assuming they were all new . They could not say where anything was or what attractions were nearby . The room was set up weird , the bathroom opened facing the bed , rather than the hall as most do . Room temp was hard to control , even though they had a digital thermostat . Overall I was very disappointed , had I been staying more than one night I would have switched hotels .

I 'll keep it short . My wife , daughter and I stayed at this hotel for 3 nights . We go on several vacations a year and this was a great hotel . Location : It is located in the center of the Magnificent Mile ( Michigan Ave. ) , so it is near or easily accessible to everything you might want to do . Hotel : The hotel itself is very clean , as were the rooms . Maid service was excellent , including 2x daily cleaning and turndown service ( I think they missed a night ) . Service : Every staff member we encountered was super friendly and kind . They always have someone at the lobby door greeting you with a smile . Every night we had milk and cookies waiting in our room ( sometimes chocolates on our pillows ) . They always pushed the elevator button for you if they were near it . There was no shortage of people to ask things . My only conplaint was that the congierge was tough to get . They shouuld have more than one , or longer hours . Other : We had breakfast in the 676 Restaurant and it was very good , and well attended , appointed . They even carried my wifes plate to the table from the buffet . The pool was a nice addition and a hit with the kids . It was nice to go for a swim after a long day of walking . Pool and changing areas were spotless . Room : Clean , sunny and spacious . Probably over 400 sq . ft. - 2 TVs , couch , desk , chairs - all in perfect shape . The windows open for some fresh air . Pillows were pretty comfortable . With all aspects considered , I think this was an unbeatable value ! I would not hesitate to stay again or recommend it to a friend . I truly have nothing negative to say about the hotel . It was a wonderful stay and we will miss being there . Omni has hit the right formula to make a guest feel like a welcomed person as opposed to just a nuisance or a number . The airlines have cornered the market on that .

Not a good start when the front desk is n't willing to tell their customers that they have a problem with your room ! We reserved a King Suite , and the hotel put us in a Queen Suite without telling us up front . Only after we confronted the Manager did they come clean about the switch , he offered us a free breakfast , but would not up-grade our room . The whole problem could have been avoided if they would have told us the truth and let us decide if we still were willing to stay at the Omni . We will not be retuning to this Hotel again .

a great hotel , we used the CTA the 2 days we were in Chicago and it is great , that the Line 6 stops nearly in front of the hotel . So we did not need any taxi and traveled from Midway to the city and to Ohare for 9 $ and we used the buses alot ( freezing cold ) . The hotel itself is great , very clean rooms , realy on of the best bathrooms i ever had . Staff very friendly , they even found me out were i can get Timerland shoes ... . and she was right i got them in one place she told me ... thats service ... I also was having a look to the gym room and the swimming pool area , did not use it and I do not know if it would have been included in the room price ... .but realy a nice view makes running easyer ... .

Stayed at the Talbott for over a week and enjoyed our stay . Room was a little noisy as we were next to the lift , but everything else made up for that . Positives : Bed was very comfortable , great to have real shower , free internet , gym usage , staff ( all friendly ) and location . Negative : Lift noise , lifts slow and restaurant ( there are so many great restaurants around - do n't bother staying in ) Would stay again !

We booked this hotel for an adult weekend away on Priceline , paid $ 85 which thought was good price for a 4* in downtown Chicago . The location is great . The hotel minimally OK > Unsure how it gets a 4* rating . It is old and though clean the decor is definitely jaded and needing a face lift . Staff were pleasant and overall it was a good stay . However I would NOT recommend this hotel . I would rather have paid $ 100 and got something more updated - trouble with old it tends to look somewhat seedy and this was true in this case . My suggestion DO NOT BOOK PRICELINE FOR CHICAGO IL AND ASK FOR 4 * BECAUSE THIS IS WHAT YOU ARE ALMOST SURE TO GET ... ..NOT GOOD ENOUGH PRICELINE. ! ! IN MY OPINION .

Stayed at the Fitzpatrick as a result of all of the glowing reviews on TripAdvisor and to avoid the normal corporate hotel . Good location but the room was dirty , and not just from the last housekeeping . It was dingy : a place where you needed the slippers they provided . And this was a suite . Also , the refrigerator was caked with ice and did n't work . Furthermore , because my travel agent had mixed up the dates I was to travel , I showed up a day late . The hotel said it was n't a problem and that I would n't be charged for the no-show the night before . I had my travel desk verify this with the hotel management the same day . Then the Fitzpatrick charged me for both nights and refused to reverse the charges after many attempts to resolve . Neither I nor my corporate travel desk will use the Fitzpatrick again . Two dots only because it 's in a good location and because the lobby was clean . I 'm generally easy to please and slow to complain but this was bad .

I booked this hotel with great expectations . I had family visiting from outside the country and wanted them to have a good experience in Chicago . Upon arriving to the hotel ( at the exact time I indicated in my reservation ) I was told I 've been `` downgraded '' to a lesser quality room . I travel very often and never had this before . Moreover , I did not hear a single `` I 'm sorry '' , it was like usual business . What bothered me the most was that the receptionist kept telling me `` I will decrease the rate for you '' `` what do you think , nice eh ? '' like he was doing me a favor ! ! ! ! They decreased the rate to that of the rooms they gave us of course ( which is the legal thing to do , since I am sure is illegal to charge me for one room and give me a lesser value one for the same money ) . They did not care that I wanted higher level room independent of value . I did not know what to say , since this never happened to me before , also with family present did not want to start arguing . The rooms were nice ( not as nice as I thought ) and location is good , however be aware that they might not honor your reservation and not even apologize for this . That is enough for me not to go back again .

Great place , great room , great location . Even though there was a big meeting going on ( Rainbow Girls in all their enormous gowns ) the only consequence for us was slow elevators . Ballroom is amazing , shops on ground floor a nice throwback . Lake views from upper floors -- we were on 17 I think -- are worth it . Concierge advice about restaurants etc was excellent . Definitly would return .

We booked 2 rooms for 2 nights on Hotwire over Labor Day weekend . We arrived at the Hard Rock at around 10:00 a.m. , and they were able to give us our rooms early . Hooray ! We were on the 5th floor ( Beatles theme ) . The rooms were very comfortable . One of our rooms was on a corner , and had lots of windows . The other was was a bit larger with fewer windows . Not a great view from our side of the hotel , but we did n't pay for a room with a view . The beds and pillows were EXTREMELY comfortable , the bathroom was full of Aveda products , and there was a bathrobe in the closet . The tv/dvd/stereo combo was nice , but we were n't in the room a lot to use it . We were warned by the front desk not to even touch the snacks/drinks as they were weighted and we 'd be charged . No problems there . We did not make use of the free fitness center , because the weather was perfect . My husband was able to go for a run through Grant Park along the waterfront instead . He said it was wonderful . We did use the free internet in our rooms . It was 'wired ' internet , but my stepdad said that was better for him anyway . The room was a bit dim at night , but we were able to read just fine using the bedside lamps . There was virtually no hall / elevator noise . The location of the Hard Rock is ideal . It is easy to get breakfast at the Corner Bakery , just blocks to either Grant Park , The Art Institute , State Street Shopping , or Michigan Ave. To sum up , there was absolutely NOTHING to complain about . We would be glad to stay here again any time .

I was attending a training conference in Chicago and opted to book my own room thru one of the online discount programs rather than stay at the rather sterile and pedestrian hotel where the conference was being held . I booked 4 nights at the Intercontinental and was pleased with the elegance and convenient location ( an easy walk to the conference ) . From the lobby to the rooms , this hotel lives up to it 's storied reputation . ( The indoor pool seems to be imported from the set of a Busby Berkeley movie ! ) And even tho ' I was there for a conference , the hotel 's location on the Mag Mile and a quick jaunt to restaurants and theaters , made for a very pleasant stay at a very affordable price .
